I appeared on <a href="http://rt.com/news/sanctions-showdown-syria-libya/">Russia Today</a> (RT) yesterday to discuss the U.S./NATO intervention in Libya as well as the situation in Syria - feel free to check it out if you are interested:<br /><br /><iframe width="425" height="349" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/by444eRvSSI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br /><br />My related article, "<a href="http://original.antiwar.com/mccarl/2011/04/25/rolling-the-dice-in-libya/">Rolling the Dice in Libya</a>," appeared on <a href="http://original.antiwar.com/mccarl/2011/04/25/rolling-the-dice-in-libya/">Antiwar.com</a> yesterday.<br /><br />Another, unrelated op-ed of mine appeared yesterday as well in the <i><a href="http://www.educationreport.org/pubs/mer/article.aspx?id=14967">Michigan Education Report</a></i>: "<a href="http://www.educationreport.org/pubs/mer/article.aspx?id=14967">National standards will stifle innovation</a>."  In it, I argue that "strict standards risk forcing students and teachers alike into a curricular straitjacket, alienating creative teachers and sapping the motivation of students."  <br /><br />You can find links to all of my online publications at my homepage, <a href="http://www.ryanmccarl.com/">www.ryanmccarl.com</a>.<br /><br />Thanks, as always, for reading.<div class="blogger-post-footer">---
