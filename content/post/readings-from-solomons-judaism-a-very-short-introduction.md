This implies that in using our concept of God to model human behavior we should not distinguish between male and female.<br />...<br />Emil Fackenheim grounds his theology in the actual resistance of Shoah [Holocaust] victims to whom no realistic hope remained: 'A philosophical Tikkun ['repair', 'restoration'] is possible after the Holocaust because a philosophical Tikkun already took place, however fragmentarily, during the Holocaust itself'; the rebirth of Israel, and a new constructive dialogue with a self-critical Christianity, are essential to this process.  Fackenheim is also noted for his statement that there should be a 614th commandment, surplus to the 613 of tradition - to survive as Jews, to remember, never to despair of God, lest we hand Hitler a posthumous victory.<br /><a name='more'></a><br />...<br />Is there such a thing as a 'just war', and if so, what are the conditions of engagement?  Out of this debate emerged the novel concept of <em>tohar ha-nesheq</em> ('purity of arms'), which demands <em>inter alia</em> that the fighting force take special risks to avoid harm to non-combatants and to minimize enemy casualties.<br />...<br />Many Jews, including secular ones, see Israel as the fulfilment of the 'national' aspirations of the Jewish people; after thousands of years of minority status, of being alienated from the host societies, and in many  cases actually prevented from becoming full citizens of the lands in which they lived, they feel that they have at last 'come home' and are able to control their own destiny within the normal limitations of independent statehood.  Israel is perceived as a secure haven for persecuted Jews; had Israel existed during the years of the Holocaust, Jews would have had somewhere to turn to.  Moreover, Israel provides the opportunity to live a fulfilling Jewish life free from the inhibitions and restrictions of minority status.<br />...<br />Large numbers of men and women have abandoned organized religion, some because they have found it intellectually untenable, more because they have found it emotionally unsatisfying, most because they have found that its demands inhibit the personal freedom which they regard as a fundamental human right.  If Western Christianity has been most strongly affected, Western Judaism runs it a close second, for both have their home in the lands which modernity and the Enlightenment were nurtured.<br />...<br />The downside of the emphasis on family values is the danger of marginalizing the stranger, the single, and the unattached.<br />...<br />The 'heroes of the spirit,' Elijah shows the conventional rabbi Baroka, are not the ostentatiously pious, not even the learned and devout like Baroka himself.... They may appear to be quite ordinary individuals, not even religious in a conventional sense, whose quiet deeds enhance the quality of life around them - the carers, the compassionate, those who use their talents to ease the burden of humanity.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.orinst.ox.ac.uk/html/staff/hjs/nsolomon.html">Norman Solomon</a><br />--<em><a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CAwQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FJudaism-Very-Short-Introduction-Introductions%2Fdp%2F0192853902&amp;ei=4GXeSo_3FYOk8AaKwvVy&amp;usg=AFQjCNGAV2jscXmj3uoFSGTQwfG8MHXsPA">Judaism: A Very Short Introduction</a></em><div class="blogger-post-footer">---
