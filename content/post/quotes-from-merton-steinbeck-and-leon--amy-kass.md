One of the most important - and most neglected - elements in the beginnings of the interior life is the ability to respond to reality, to see the value and beauty in ordinary things, to come alive to the splendor that is all around us in the creatures of God. We do not see these things because we have withdrawn from them. <br /><br />--Thomas Merton, <em>No Man is an Island</em><br /><br />There's absolutely nothing to take the place of a good man.<br /><br />--John Steinbeck, <em>Travels with Charley</em><br /><br />For asceticism is not merely a matter of renouncing television, cigarettes, and gin. Before we can begin to be ascetics, we first have to learn to see life as if it were something more than a hypnotizing telecast. And we must be able to taste something besides tobacco and alcohol: we must perhaps be able to taste these luxuries themselves as if they too were good.<br /><br />--Thomas Merton, <em>No Man is an Island</em><br /><br />But Charley doesn't have our problems. He doesn't belong to a species clever enough to split the atom but not clever enough to live in peace with itself. He doesn't even know about race, nor is he concerned with his sister's marriage. It's quite the opposite. Once Charley fell in love with a daschund, a romance racially unsuitable, physically ridiculous, and mechanically impossible. But all these problems Charley ignored. He loved deeply and tried dogfully.<br /><br />--John Steinbeck, <em>Travels with Charley</em><br /><br />For in truth, despite their differences, those who treasure marriage in fact stand on common ground: whether religious or secular, they take human life in all its seriousness, affirm its goodness, and commit themselves in hope to its indefinite renewal and perpetuation.<br /><br />--Leon and Amy Kass, <em>Wing to Wing, Oar to Oar</em><br /><br />...<div class="blogger-post-footer">---
