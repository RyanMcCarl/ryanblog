I traveled to Northfield, MN this weekend to race in the NCAA Division III Cross Country National Championships - the final cross-country race of my life. The experience was intense: the race was taped and relayed to an enormous screen for spectators; the "boxes" that show runners where to stand on the starting line were separated by physical barriers instead of the usual paint on the ground; huge circular blue NCAA logos were painted at the start and the finish; and the race was narrated by an announcer. Every runner received a duffel-bag, fleece blanket, mittens, and headwrap with the race logo. The numbers we pinned to the front and back of our singlets had our names printed on them.<br /><br />It was fun but nerve-racking. I was assigned to the spot on the line next to Peter Kosgei of Hamilton, who took 2nd overall and got off the starting line faster than anyone I have ever seen in an 8k race. The entire field got out fast, as everyone was concerned about the sharp right turn about 200 meters from the start. After that turn, I couldn't change my position for the entire first mile; I was out uncomfortably fast, and I was being shoved around from both sides and from the back.<br /><br />At the mile, I was finally able to move to the outside and find some space to go around people; I took the gamble and moved into the top 50 by 1.5 miles, but at that point I realized that I was already largely exhausted and would not be able to sustain the pace for another 3.5 miles. And so the goal changed from racing to be an All-American to hanging on and finishing the race with a respectable time. Racing to pass people is much more fun than racing to survive, and it felt pretty miserable to be passed by about 100 people between the 2-mile and the finish. I finished 141st with a decent time of 26:03 on a tough course. The official results are <a href="http://athletics.uchicago.edu/ccmen/mcc-results-2007/mcc-ncaa-2007.txt">here</a>.<br /><br />Not a fun race, but the season itself was the best I could ever ask for. All-Region, First-Team All-Conference, the U of C school record, and a lot of great experiences, travels, and new friendships. Now it's time to relax, finish the academic quarter, find a job for next year, and eat as many cheeseburgers as I can get my hands on.<div class="blogger-post-footer">---
