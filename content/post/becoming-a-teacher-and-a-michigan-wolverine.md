I'm excited to report that I have decided to enter the University of Michigan School of Education's Secondary MAC (MA in Education with Secondary Certification) program in mid-June.  The program is 12 months long and includes over 1,000 hours of classroom experience as a student teacher and substitute teacher, resulting in full certification.<br /><br />I look forward to finding unique ways to show my students the importance of learning and reading as well as the value of informed engagement with current events and politics.  I also want to grow into a caring and effective mentor.  And, finally, I hope to learn from my classroom experience in order to become a more informed and articulate advocate for education reform.<br /><br />I am very, very sad to be moving from Chicago after living here for five years.  I will miss my tiny apartment in East Lakeview and having easy access to my favorite places - the lakefront, Mickey's Grille, Avenue Tavern, and Stella's Diner in East Lakeview, the Noble Tree Cafe in Lincoln Park, the Grind and the Old Town School of Folk Music in Lincoln Square, the Pub and Powell's Books in Hyde Park, Myopic Books in Wicker Park, Lao Beijing in Chinatown, and the Borders on Michigan Ave., among others.  But I will be visiting at least once a month over the next year.<br /><br />The next three weeks will be incredibly busy.  I'll be packing, moving, finding a subletter in Chicago and a temporary place to stay in Ann Arbor, working for a few more weeks, and spending as much time as possible with my friends in Chicago.  But I am thrilled to be entering the program and stepping into the next stage of my life and career.<div class="blogger-post-footer">---
