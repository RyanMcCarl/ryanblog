Of these at least no one can deprive him, though both the prosperity of world war and the fulfilment of important people's ideals have proved to be no more than a cloud of dust that has swirled up to obscure the lone worker's vision.<br />...<br />To be able to look forward is to live.<br />...<br />Human life isn't long enough for a peasant to become a man of means.<br />...<br />He had never asked for any other joy than the joy of knowing that the sheep were breeding with good result in their regular season, and of seeing them weather the winter strong enough to struggle out of the bogs in spring.  Perhaps that is the true joy.<br />...<br />And yet he did not find the happiness he had dreamed of, nor the peace he had so much desired, and she understood him, and loved him for that very reason, that he had found neither happiness nor peace.<br />...<br />And to be able to look forward to the morrow in joyful expectation is good fortune indeed.<br />...<br />They groped involuntarily for one another's hand, fearful that they might be alone; what more was it really possible to do?  Thus they stood, holding hands and shivering as the moon disappeared into a deeper and deeper gloom; they were wanting coffee, they were cold.</span><br /><br />Halldor Laxness<br />--<em>Independent People</em> (<em>Sjálfstætt fólk</em><div class="blogger-post-footer">---
