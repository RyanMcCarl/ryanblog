The course at Wisconsin-Parkside is designed specifically for cross-country: it isn't a golf course with a white line drawn through it. It has handmade signs marking each quarter-mile, it has hills and trails through woods, and the start is sounded with a cannon rather than a gun. From the starting line, runners look forward and see an enormous hill surrounded by trees, and above the hill, the cloud-filled Wisconsin sky.<br /><br />Whenever I am in Wisconsin, I feel at home. In the <em>Aeneid, </em>Virgil writes of people's desire for a "permanent shore." When I think of my own permanent shore, I think of the upper Midwest, and places filled with lakes and trees, where Saturday mornings in the fall are spent at cross-country meets.<br /><br />Here are our team results for the day (out of 17 teams, 187 runners):<br /><br />6.
