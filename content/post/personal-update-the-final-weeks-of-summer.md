This will be my fourth and final year as a member of the squad, and I am more excited about the sport and ready to race than I've been in years. We begin to miss things and feel the pain of losing them before they go, and being a member of an XC team has been a big part of my life for almost eight years. I will miss it.<br /><br />I spent most of the past week reading social science and other nonfiction stuff at Barnes & Noble and Good Grains in Muskegon: <em>Economics Explained</em> by Robert Heilbroner and Lester Thurow, <em>Global Political Economy </em>by Robert Gilpin, a sociology textbook, a book on expressing emotions in Japanese, and an introductory religious studies textbook. I focused on literature all summer because I was dealing with numbers and facts all day at my job and because I was searching for direction. Now I must get into the groove of reading duller and tougher materials in order to prepare for the academic year.<br /><br />The weekend was also nice: Mona Shores beat Muskegon Catholic Central for the second straight year in football on a beautiful Friday night. On Saturday, I won the Roosevelt Park Days 5k in 15:54, hung out all morning with my family and watched my 8 year-old sister in the parade, and then drove to my grandparents' cottage in Baldwin for a weekend of kayaking, looking at the stars with Grandpa on the dock, eating at backwoods diners, writing, and watching <em>Stranger Than Fiction</em>. Driving home through the hills and farmland of west-central Michigan, I felt outrageously happy to be alive. I get that feeling a lot these days. Fall is my favorite season: indoor warmth, Saturday morning meets, football, excitement about school, and hope for new beginnings.<br /><br />This week, training and preparing for the school year in Chicago; Friday, the first race of the 2007 cross-country season (in Elmhurst); Saturday, an overnight stay in Ann Arbor to watch the Michigan vs. Appalachian State football game; another three days in Muskegon; and then, next Wednesday afternoon, I'll step off a plane and be in Tokyo for a two-week stay.<br /><br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_dbkE5wB5Kaw/RtMCmSjEbQI/AAAAAAAAAEU/q2Kt65gQ85E/s1600-h/2007_0824August-20070033.JPG"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5103425659578117378" style="FLOAT: left; MARGIN: 0px 10px 10px 0px; CURSOR: hand" alt='" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_dbkE5wB5Kaw/RtMCmSjEbQI/AAAAAAAAAEU/q2Kt65gQ85E/s400/2007_0824August-20070033.JPG" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />---<br />What might have been is just thin air,<br />A loss we long ago outgrew.<br /><br />--Czeslaw Milosz, "In Salem"<br /><br /><strong>After Paradise</strong><br /><br />Don't run anymore. Quiet. How softly it rains<br />On the roofs of the city. How perfect<br />All things are. Now, for the two of you<br />Waking up in a royal bed by a garret window.<br />For a man and a woman. For one plant divided<br />Into masculine and feminine which longed for each other.<br />Yes, this is my gift to you. Above ashes<br />On a bitter, bitter earth. Above the subterranean<br />Echo of clamorings and vows. So that now at dawn<br />You must be attentive: the tilt of a head,<br />A hand with a comb, two faces in a mirror<br />Are only forever once, even if unremembered,<br />So that you watch what is, though it fades away,<br />And are grateful every moment for your being.<br />Let that little park with greenish marble busts<br />In the pearl-gray light, under a summer drizzle,<br />Remain as it was when you opened the gate.<br />And the street of tall peeling porticoes<br />Which this love of yours suddenly transformed.<br /><br /><em>--Czeslaw Milosz</em><div class="blogger-post-footer">---
