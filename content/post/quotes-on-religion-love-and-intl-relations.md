Every summer he's on the prarie harvesting wheat and every winter in the Wisconsin forests chopping cordwood. That's his life.<br /><br />A life maybe as good as any other.<br /><br />--Knut Hamsun, "On the Prarie" (from <em>Tales of Love and Loss</em>)<br /><br />The theological dimension is needed both for interpreting and for solving present day problems in human society.<br /><br />--Pope John Paul II, <em>Centesimus Annus</em><br /><br />The human being is made for love and cannot live without love. When it is manifested as the total gift of two persons in their complementarities, love cannot be reduced to emotions or feelings, much less to mere sexual expression. In a society that tends more and more to relativize and trivialize the very experience of love and sexuality, exalting its fleeting aspects and obscuring its fundamental values, it is more urgent than ever to proclaim and bear witness that the <em>truth</em> of conjugal love and sexuality exist where there is a full and total gift of persons, with the characteristics of <em>unity </em>and <em>fidelity</em>. This truth, a source of joy, hope, and life, remains impenetrable and unattainable as long as people close themselves off in relativism and skepticism.<br /><br />--Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace, <em>Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church</em><br /><br />We lived through much happiness and unhappiness,<br />Separations, miraculous rescues. And now, this ash.<br />And the sea battering the shore when I walk the empty boulevard.<br />And the sea battering the shore. And ordinary sorrow.<br /><br />--Czeslaw Milosz, <em>from </em>"On Parting With my Wife, Janina"<br /><br />Enemy images have a long pedigree, and some states continue to position each other in such terms today. The Greeks represented the Persians as "barbarians"; the Crusaders perceived the Turks as "infidels"; medieval Europeans feared their defeat at Liegnitz at the hands of the Mongols heralded Armageddon; later Europeans treated the peoples of the Americas as savages; conservatives thought civilization was threatened by the French Revolution; and, in our own century, we have the Armenian genocide, the Holocaust, the early Cold War, Northern Ireland, Pol Pot, Palestinian and Israeli fundamentalists, the Bosnian Civil War, Hutus and Tutsis - all based on representations of the Other as intent on destroying or enslaving the Self.<br /><br />It is important to recognize that this concept implies nothing about whether enemy images are justified. Some enemies are "real," in that the Other really does existentially threaten the Self, as the Nazis did the Jews, and others are "chimeras," as the Jews were to the Nazis. ...Real or imagined, if actors think enemies are real then they are real in their consequences.<br /><br />--Alexander Wendt, <em>Social Theory of International Politics</em><div class="blogger-post-footer">---
