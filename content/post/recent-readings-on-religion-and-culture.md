He who refuses to embrace a unique opportunity loses the prize as surely as if he tried and failed.<br />...<br />Our errors are surely not such awfully solemn things. In a world where we are so certain to incur them in spite of all our caution, a certain lightness of heart seems healthier than this excessive nervousness on their behalf.<br />...<br />Let us give the name <em>hypothesis</em> to anything that may be proposed to our belief; and just as the electricians speak of live and dead wires, let us speak of any hypothesis as either <em>live</em> or <em>dead</em>. A live hypothesis is one which appears as a real possibility to him to whom it is proposed. If I ask you to believe in the Mahdi, the notion makes no electric connection with your nature, - it refuses to scintillate with any credibility at all. As an hypothesis it is completely dead. To an Arab, however (even if he be not one of the Mahdi's followers), the hypothesis is among the mind's possibilities: it is alive. This shows that deadness and liveness in an hypothesis are not intrinsic properties, but relations to the individual thinker.<br /><br />William James<br />--"The Will to Believe"<br /><br />The distance, and as it were the space around man, grows with the strength of his intellectual vision and insight: his world becomes profounder; new stars, new enigmas, and notions are ever coming into view. Perhaps everything on which the intellectual eye has exercised its acuteness and profundity has just been an occasion for its exercise, something of a game, something for children and childish minds.<br /><br />Friedrich Nietzsche<br />--<em>Beyond Good and Evil</em><br /><em></em><br />The perspective of the 'unbeliever' on the traditional forms of belief has seldom been welcomed with any enthusiasm inside the communities of faith, but in spite of that it has provided an invaluable service to them. If one were to write the history of modern reform movements within the several world religions, the critical outsider would have to be accorded a substantial position in such a history.<br /><br />Jaroslav Pelikan<br />--<em>The World Treasury of Modern Religious Thought</em><br /><br />Many of today’s churches have bought the culture’s lie that religion is not about sex or anything else of much importance. But, as theologian Sarah Coakley has so brilliantly said, ancient Christian reflection on desire shows that Freud is exactly wrong: Talk about God is not repressed talk about sexuality; talk about sex is, in fact, repressed talk about God. To paraphrase C.S. Lewis, porn users are not to be rebuked for desiring too much but for desiring too little.<br /><br />--Jason Byassee, "<a href="http://www.firstthings.com/article.php3?id_article=6105">Not Your Father's Pornography</a>" (<em>First Things, </em>January 2008)<div class="blogger-post-footer">---
