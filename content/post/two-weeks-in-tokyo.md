It's a 12-hour flight and a 13-hour difference from eastern time, so I'll arrive in Tokyo around 4 pm on Thursday.  Then, I'll figure out how to ride the bus from Narita to Shinjuku, the district in the photo, and at Shinjuku I'll meet up with my friend Ai.<br /><br />I became friends with Ai when she was an exchange student in my hometown of Muskegon, MI, during my senior year of high school; although I haven't seen her in over three years, we've kept in touch through letters and emails.  I'll be staying with Ai and making the most of Tokyo for two weeks, seeing as much as I can and improving my Japanese as much as possible in the process. <br /><br />On Sunday, I'll also spend the day with the Takada family, the wonderful host parents and sisters I stayed with for six weeks as an exchange student near Tokyo in the summer before my senior year of high school.<br /><br />Naturally, I don't want to spend any of this precious time typing in English and surfing the Internet.  So the blog is on hiatus until September 20th or so.  Thank you, as always, for reading, and feel free to browse the archives.<br /><br />As always, I will take hundreds of photos and keep a detailed travel journal these next two weeks, and I will post some of that on this blog when I return.  Until then:  <em>Ja, ne.</em><div class="blogger-post-footer">---
