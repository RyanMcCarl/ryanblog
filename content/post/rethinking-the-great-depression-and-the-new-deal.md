I've become increasingly interested in the history of the 1930s, and&nbsp;I just finished Eric Rauchway's <i><a href="http://t.co/IdP1dDU">The Great Depression and the New Deal: A Very Short Introduction</a></i>. &nbsp;It has become increasingly clear to me that there are major holes in the dominant historical narrative about the Great Depression, the New Deal, and the Roosevelt administration. &nbsp;The standard, high-school-textbook version of the story goes something like this: <br /><br />"Greedy stock market speculators caused the stock market crash of 1929, which triggered the worst depression in American history; President Herbert Hoover believed in an outdated&nbsp;<i>laissez-faire</i>&nbsp;economic philosophy, so he did nothing; thankfully, President Roosevelt was elected, and his New Deal policies saved capitalism and helped the common man survive the Great Depression; and finally, World War II was an enormous boon to the U.S. economy, and it finally solved the problem once and for all."<br /><br />Those of us with a preference for economic liberty and peace should be greatly disturbed by this story. &nbsp;If true, it suggests that&nbsp;the best ways to fix a broken economy are&nbsp;(1) total war, including conscription; and (2) dramatic increases in government taxation, spending, regulation, and redistribution.<br /><br />Thankfully, there are convincing reasons to believe that the standard narrative is wrong. &nbsp;There is a lot more I need to read on the topic, but here are some resources and ideas that I look forward to exploring further:<br /><br /><br /><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">-Murray N.
