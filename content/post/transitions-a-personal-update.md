No more than three weeks after making my final decision to move to Ann Arbor to pursue an M.A. in Education at the University of Michigan and become a high school history teacher, it is happening: my furniture is being sold or moved, my possessions are being sorted into boxes.  Yesterday was my last day at the bookstore I've worked at as a manager since August.  On Friday I'll be on the road to Muskegon with a stuffed car and another empty apartment behind me, and on Sunday I'll be in Ann Arbor to begin the next stage of my life.<br /><br />I feel alive with the movement of it all: "A man gets up, a few strokes of a brush and then already it's evening."
