<strong><em>From </em>Ten-Day Leave</strong><br /><br />Oh, identity is a traveling-piece with some,<br />But here is what calls me, here what I call home.<br /><strong></strong><br /><strong>A Major Work</strong><br /><br />Poems are hard to read<br />Pictures are hard to see<br />Music is hard to hear<br />And people are hard to love.<br /><br />But whether from brute need<br />Or divine energy<br />At last mind eye and ear<br />And the great sloth heart will move.<br /><br /><strong><em>From </em>June: Dutch Harbor</strong><br /><em></em><br />It is hard to keep your mind on war, with all that green.<br /><br /><strong>The Open Sea</strong><br /><br />We say the sea is lonely; better say<br />Ourselves are lonesome creatures whom the sea<br />Gives neither yes or no for company.<br /><br />Oh, there are people, all right, settled in the sea-<br />It is as populous as Maine today-<br />But no one who will give you the time of day.<br /><br />A man who asks there of his family<br />Or a friend or teacher gets a cold reply<br />Or finds him dead against that vast majority.<br /><br />They are speechless. And the famous noise of the sea,<br />Which a poet has beautifully told us in our day,<br />Is hardly a sound to speak comfort to the lonely.<br /><br />Although not yet a man given to prayer, I pray<br />For each creature lost since the start of the sea,<br />And give thanks that it was not I, nor yet one close to me.<br /><br />-<em>From William Meredith, </em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Effort-Speech-New-Selected-Poems/dp/0810150719/ref=sr_1_3/002-8606436-4954458?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1193894320&amp;sr=8-3">Effort at Speech: New and Selected Poems</a><div class="blogger-post-footer">---
