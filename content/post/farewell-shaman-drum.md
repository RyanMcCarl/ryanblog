It is a major loss for Ann Arbor and for book-lovers everywhere.<br /><br />Independent and used bookstores need your support.  Shop at them.  Go to their events.  Buy their gift certificates as holiday gifts.<br /><br />Independent bookstores must fight back against the challenging economic environment by doing everything they can to improve their businesses.  Here are a few ideas:<br /><br />-Keep a constant flow of new inventory, and mark down unsaleable material to maintain a high-quality bibliography;<br /><br />-Follow the lead of chain bookstores in taking full advantage of the "retail calendar" of holidays through decorations and displays of recommended holiday-related books.<br /><br />-Create a pleasant, shoppable atmosphere.  I personally look for classical music and places to sit while I look over a pile of books.<br /><br />-Stock or display local art and photography as well as books.<br /><br />-Stock books and periodicals for book-lovers, especially the stuff that is harder to find at chain stores.  Out-of-print titles that remain relevant; major and local literary journals and serious newspapers; complete backlists of major, second-tier, and local literary writers.<br /><br />-Sell coffee from a pot for $1 a cup.<br /><br />-Become an integral part of your community by hosting frequent author events and becoming a local arts hub.  Create a space for gatherings such as writers' groups and reading groups.  Stock the newspapers and arts magazines of local high schools and colleges.<br /><br />You can keep track of the independent book business by reading <a href="http://www.indiebound.org/">Indiebound</a> and <a href="http://shelf-awareness.com/">Shelf Awareness</a>.<div class="blogger-post-footer">---
