<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">I once said that, after the experiences of the last two years, I could no longer hold to any truth which might oblige me, directly or indirectly, to demand a man's life.  Certain friends whom I respected retorted that I was living in Utopia, that there was no political truth which could not one day reduce us to such an extremity, and that we must therefore either run the risk of this extremity or else simply put up with the world as it is.</span><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"><br /></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">They argued the point most forcefully.  But I think they were able to put such force into it only because they were unable to really </span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">imagine</span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"> other people's death.  It is a freak of the times.  We make love by telephone, we work not on matter but on machines, and we kill and are killed by proxy.  We gain in cleanliness, but lose in understanding.</span></div><div><br /></div><div>Albert Camus</div><div>  --"Neither Victims nor Executioners," in David P.
