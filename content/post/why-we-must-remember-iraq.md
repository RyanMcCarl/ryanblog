“<a href="http://original.antiwar.com/mccarl/the-next-forgotten-war/">The Next Forgotten War</a>,” an op-ed of mine, was published on <a href="http://www.antiwar.com/">Antiwar.com</a> this morning; check it out <a href="http://original.antiwar.com/mccarl/the-next-forgotten-war/">here</a>. &nbsp;In it, I argue that we must keep the memory of the Iraq War, and the individuals caught up in its maelstroms, alive:<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">"As Iraq recedes from the headlines and slips from the public’s mind to make room for the next 'crisis,' we have a responsibility to give some thought to the two million Iraqi refugees displaced by the war and the tens of thousands of Americans and Iraqis killed or maimed as a consequence of the war. And what we should remember is not statistics or grand narratives, but individual stories and the weight they lend to the principles of prudence, humanism, and nonviolence."<br /></span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"><br /></span><br />If you enjoy the article, please consider <a href="http://www.blogger.com/As%20Iraq%20recedes%20from%20the%20headlines%20and%20slips%20from%20the%20public%E2%80%99s%20mind%20to%20make%20room%20for%20the%20next%20%22crisis,%22%20we%20have%20a%20responsibility%20to%20give%20some%20thought%20to%20the%20two%20million%20Iraqi%20refugees%20displaced%20by%20the%20war%20and%20the%20tens%20of%20thousands%20of%20Americans%20and%20Iraqis%20killed%20or%20maimed%20as%20a%20consequence%20of%20the%20war.%20And%20what%20we%20should%20remember%20is%20not%20statistics%20or%20grand%20narratives,%20but%20individual%20stories%20and%20the%20weight%20they%20lend%20to%20the%20principles%20of%20prudence,%20humanism,%20and%20nonviolence.">linking to it</a> or sharing it with others you think may be interested.<div class="blogger-post-footer">---
