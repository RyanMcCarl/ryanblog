"Tell me one last thing," said Harry. "Is this real? Or has this been happening inside my head?"<br />...<br />"Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real?"<br /><br />-J.K. Rowling, <em>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</em><br /><br />Secular nationalism of the sort Fatah stood for is coming to look like the weak force and radical Islam like the strong force. This poses a huge danger to a region already beset by violent conflicts. What is worse, Western policy is in danger of strengthening the wrong side by making the Islamists look like martyrs and the secularists like traitors.<br /><br />-"Martyrs or Traitors," <em>The Economist</em>, June 21st 2007<br /><br />This competition for students would force public schools to become better.  The system of higher education in the U.S. is the world's best mainly because competition between private colleges and tuition-charging public colleges has improved the performance of both.<br /><br />-Gary Becker, "School-Finance Reform: Don't Give Up on Vouchers," in <em>The Economics of Life</em><br /><br />But if you will just change your ways immediately, then everyone will have peace.  Although this has been going on since time immemorial, today we could make a special effort to be good, and say this is not to be done!  I'm sure you can say so, brother.  The other day when the tenant wanted the rent reduced, you said it couldn't be done.<br /><br />-Lu Hsun, "A Madman's Diary"<div class="blogger-post-footer">---
