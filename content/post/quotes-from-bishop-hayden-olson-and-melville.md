<em>From</em> <strong>The Man-Moth</strong><br /><br />He thinks the moon is a small hole at the top of the sky,<br />proving the sky quite useless for protection.<br /><br />--Elizabeth Bishop<br /><br /><em>From</em> <strong>Mourning Poem for the Queen of Sunday</strong><br /><br />Oh who and oh who will sing Jesus down<br />to help with struggling and doing without and being colored<br />all through blue Monday?<br />Till way next Sunday?<br /><br />--Robert Hayden<br /><br /><em>From</em> <strong>Questions of Travel</strong><br /><br />Should we have stayed at home,<br />wherever that may be?<br /><br />--Elizabeth Bishop<br /><br /><em>From</em> <strong>Maximus, to Himself</strong><br /><br />It is undone business<br />I speak of, this morning,<br />with the sea<br />stretching out<br />from my feet.<br /><br />--Charles Olson<br /><br />Again: as the profound calm which only apparently precedes and prophesies of the storm, is perhaps more awful than the storm itself; for, indeed, the calm is but the wrapper and envelope of the storm; and contains it in itself, as the seemingly harmless rifle holds the fatal powder, and the ball, and the explosion; so the graceful repose of the line, as it silently serpentines about the oarsmen before being brought into actual play - this is a thing which carries more of true terror than any other aspect of this dangerous affair. But why say more? All men live enveloped in whale-lines. All are born with halters round their necks; but it is only when caught in the swift, sudden turn of death, that mortals realize the silent, subtle, ever-present perils of life. And if you be a philosopher, though seated in the whale-boat, you would not at heart feel one whit more of terror, than though seated before your evening fire with a poker, and not a harpoon, by your side.<br /><br />Hermann Melville<br />--<em>Moby-Dick</em><br /><br />(Poems excerpted from <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Norton-Anthology-Modern-Contemporary-Poetry/dp/039332429X">The Norton Anthology of Modern and Contemporary Poetry</a>)</em><div class="blogger-post-footer">---
