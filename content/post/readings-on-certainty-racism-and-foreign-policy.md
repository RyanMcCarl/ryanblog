-Today's Maroon <a href="http://maroon.uchicago.edu/online_edition/viewpoints/2007/10/16/certainty-is-a-luxury-none-of-us-has/">column</a>: "Certainty is a luxury none of us has."  Religious fundamentalists and secular fundamentalists are all-too-alike in their belief that they, and only they, have answers to the biggest questions in the human dialogue.  What unites us all is doubt and searching.  Read the article <a href="http://maroon.uchicago.edu/online_edition/viewpoints/2007/10/16/certainty-is-a-luxury-none-of-us-has/">here</a>.<br /><br />-Must-read: "<a href="http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/10/16/principal-of-citys-arabic-school-says-she-was-forced-out/index.html?ex=1350273600&amp;en=5fc98d5704a026df&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss">Principal of Arabic School Says She was Forced Out</a>."  This is what racist, nativist hysteria looks like.<br /><br />-From an Economist <a href="http://www.economist.com/displayStory.cfm?story_id=9973918&amp;fsrc=RSS">article</a> on the new Fox Business Channel: <em>Mr Murdoch apparently wants his channel to be more “pro-capitalism” than CNBC—which is hardly a pinko outfit—and, sure enough, there was soon a discussion about the pharmaceutical industry entitled "Capitalism cures cancer", which—let’s be “fair and balanced”, as the Fox News slogan puts it—it does</em>.<br /><br />-MIT international relations scholar Barry Posen on "<a href="http://www.the-american-interest.com/ai2/article.cfm?Id=331&amp;MId=16">the case for restraint</a>" in U.S. foreign policy.  I haven't read this yet, but I generally like what Posen has to say.  Responses from Francis Fukuyama, Stephen Krasner, G. John Ikenberry, and others are also online.<div class="blogger-post-footer">---
