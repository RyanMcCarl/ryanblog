It was my last team trip as a member of a collegiate cross-country squad, and memories were made. We traveled to beautiful, spacious Oshkosh, WI for the Midwest Regional meet. Shortly before the starting gun, huddling with the team, doing stride-outs, and giving high-fives, I realized that I was doing all of these things for the last time, and in a moment of clarity I understood how much cross-country has meant to me for the past 8 years.<br /><br />Conditions were flawless - 45 degrees, hard ground, a flat course, winds under 10 mph - and everyone on the team had a performance they could be proud to end the season with. The men finished 12th and the women finished 14th out of 35 teams. There were several personal bests, and Liz Lawton made All-Region on the women's side.<br /><br />I ran 24:33 - 57 seconds faster than my P.R. of two weeks ago - finishing 7th overall, qualifying for the national championships, and setting a new University of Chicago cross-country school record. It was far and away the best race of my life, and I'm still feeling high from it. In <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Anna Karenina</span>, Leo Tolstoy describes the emotion like this: <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:85%;">Yet that grief and this joy were alike outside all the ordinary conditions of life; they were loopholes, as it were, in that ordinary life through which there came glimpses of something sublime. And in the contemplation of this sublime something the soul was exalted to inconceivable heights of which it had before had no conception, while reason lagged behind, unable to keep up.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:85%;"><br /></span></p>12.
