Today, I had the priviledge of listening to the American ambassador to South Korea and the South Korean ambassador to the U.S. give a joint talk on political and economic conditions on the Korean peninsula. Both ambassadors centered their speeches around the issues of the recently agreed-upon <a href="http://www.ustr.gov/Document_Library/Press_Releases/2007/April/United_States_Korea_Conclude_Historic_Trade_Agreement.html">KORUS FTA</a>, or United States - Korea Free Trade Agreement, and the recent breakthrough on the North Korean nuclear issue.<br /><br />The KORUS FTA would be the biggest free trade agreement involving the U.S. since NAFTA; as such, it will run into a lot of opposition in Congress. There are plenty of domestic interest groups that benefit from the tariffs we place on imports from South Korea; the beef lobby will be especially difficult to placate, I was told. But it will be a major boost for most American businesses and consumers. South Korea is a staunch ally and the twelfth largest economy in the world.<br /><br />On the security side of things, the ambassadors spoke cautiously of a recent breakthrough in which the North Koreans agreed to dismantle their nuclear program and admit IAEA (Int'l Atomic Energy Agency) inspectors in exchange for reduced sanctions and normalization talks. As a first step, the U.S. freed $25 million of North Korean funds this week that we had frozen in a bank in Macau. If North Korea follows through, this could be a sign of enormous progress.<div class="blogger-post-footer">---
