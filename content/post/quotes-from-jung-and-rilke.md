Man is not a machine that can be remodelled for quite other purposes as occasion demands, in the hope that it will go on functioning as regularly as before but in a quite different way. He carries his whole history with him; in his very structure is written the history of mankind.<br /><br />...<br /><br />This is the extravert's danger: he gets sucked into objects and completely loses himself in them.<br /><br />C.G. Jung<br />--<em>Psychological Types</em><br /><br /><em>From </em><strong>The Duino Elegies</strong> by Rainer Maria Rilke:<br /><br />Who's not sat tense before his own heart's curtain?<br />Up it would go: the scenery was parting.<br /><br />--<em>From</em> "The Fourth Elegy"<br /><br />Do you really suppose your gentle approach could have so<br />convulsed him, you, that wander like morning-breezes?<br />You terrified his heart, indeed; but more ancient terrors<br />rushed into him in that instant of shattering contact.<br /><br />-- <em>From</em> "The Third Elegy"<br /><br />I know why you so blissfully touch: because the caress persists,<br />because it does not vanish, the place that you<br />so tenderly cover; because you perceive thereupon<br />pure duration.  Until your embraces almost<br />promise eternity.  Yet, when you've once withstood<br />the startled first encounter, the window-longing,<br />and that first walk, just once, through the garden together:<br />Lovers, are you the same?  When you lift yourselves<br />up to each other's lips - drink unto drink:<br />oh, how strangely the drinker eludes his part!<br /><br />...Were not love and farewell<br />so lightly laid upon shoulders, they seemed to be made<br />of other stuff than with us?  Remember the hands,<br />how they rest without pressure, though power is there in the torsos.<br />The wisdom of those self-masters was this: we have got so far;<br />ours is to touch one another like this; the gods<br />may press more strongly upon us.  But that is the gods' affair.<br /><br />--<em>From</em> "The Second Elegy"<div class="blogger-post-footer">---
