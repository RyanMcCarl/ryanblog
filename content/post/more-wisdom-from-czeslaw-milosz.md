<em>From</em> <strong>An Appeal</strong><br /><strong></strong><br />In you, as in me, there is a hidden certainty<br />That soon you will rise, in undiminished light,<br />And be real, strong, free from what restrained you.<br /><em></em><br /><em>From </em><strong>Notes</strong><br /><br />He felt thankful, so he couldn't not believe in God.<br /><br /><em>From </em><strong>A Poetic State</strong><br /><br />Every minute the spectacle of the world astonishes me; it is so comic that I cannot understand how literature could expect to cope with it.<br /><br />Sensing every minute, in my flesh, by my touch, I tame misfortune and do not ask God to avert it, for why should He avert it from me if He does not avert it from others?<br />...<br />I was impatient and easily irritated by time lost on trifles among which I ranked cleaning and cooking.  Now, attentively, I cut onions, squeeze lemons, and prepare various kinds of sauces.<br /><br /><em>From </em><strong>After Paradise</strong><br /><br />So that now at dawn<br />You must be attentive: the tilt of a head,<br />A hand with a comb, two faces in a mirror<br />Are only forever once, even if unremembered,<br />So that you watch what is, though it fades away,<br />And are grateful every moment for your being.<br /><br /><em>From</em> <strong>From the Rising of the Sun</strong><br /><br />Darkly, darkly cities return.<br />The roads of a twenty-year-old are littered with maple leaves<br />As he walks along one acrid morning, looking through the fences at gardens<br />And courtyards, where a black dog barks, and someone chops wood.<br /><br />---<br />Click here to see Milosz's <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/New-Collected-Poems-Czeslaw-Milosz/dp/0060514485/ref=sr_1_1/104-5107741-5563931?ie=UTF8&s=books&amp;qid=1185423070&sr=8-1">Collected Poems</a> </em>on Amazon.com.  Milosz is my favorite poet, and much more of his work can be found in older posts on this blog.<br />---<div class="blogger-post-footer">---
