Not the best day for the UCXC men: we were hoping to place around seventh or eighth at the Loyola Invitational, the gold division of which is packed with DI and DII teams, but no one ran particularly well, and we wound up in thirteenth.<br /><br />In the final steps of the race, I was hit by the problem of overheating I occasionally get when I race - suddenly, all strength goes out of my limbs, moving a single step becomes a major effort, my body has begun to burn muscle instead of calories/fat, and I feel as though I might black out. After the race, I was barely conscious and could not open my eyes more than a fraction, my feet and legs were racked with cramps, and my head burned with a dehydration headache. It is an extraordinarily unpleasant experience, but things ended up fine.<br /><br />13. University of Chicago (359 points)<br />---<br /><br />44. Ryan McCarl (Sr.) (26:00)<br />57.
