<strong>Mus√©e des Beaux Arts</strong><br /><strong></strong><br />About suffering they were never wrong,<br />The Old Masters: how well they understood<br />Its human position; how it takes place<br />While someone else is eating or opening a window or just walking dully along;<br />How when the aged are reverently, passionately waiting<br />For the miraculous birth, there always must be<br />Children who did not specially want it to happen, skating<br />On a pond at the edge of the wood:<br />They never forgot<br />That even the dreadful martyrdom must run its course<br />Anyhow in a corner, some untidy spot<br />Where the dogs go on with their doggy life and the torturer's horse<br />Scratches its innocent behind on a tree.<br />In Brueghel's Icarus, for instance: how everything turns away<br />Quite leisurely from the disaster; the ploughman may<br />Have heard the splash, the forsaken cry,<br />But for him it was not an important failure; the sun shone<br />As it had to on the white legs disappearing into the green<br />Water; and the expensive delicate ship that must have seen<br />Something amazing, a boy falling out of the sky,<br />Had somewhere to get to and sailed calmly on.<br /><em></em><br /><em>From </em><strong>Lay your sleeping head, my love</strong><br /><br />Lay your sleeping head, my love,<br />Human on my faithless arm;<br />...<br />Certainly, fidelity<br />On the stroke of midnight pass<br />Like vibrations of a bell,<br />And fashionable madmen raise<br />Their pedantic boring cry:<br />Every farthing of the cost,<br />All the dreaded cards foretell,<br />Shall be paid, but from this night<br />Not a whisper, not a thought,<br />Not a kiss nor look be lost.<br /><br /><em>From </em><strong>September 1, 1939</strong><br /><br />Faces along the bar<br />Cling to their average day:<br />The lights must never go out,<br />The music must always play,<br />All the conventions conspire<br />To make this fort assume<br />The furniture of home;<br />Lest we should see where we are,<br />Lost in a haunted wood,<br />Children afraid of the night<br />Who have never been happy or good.<br />...<br />May I, composed like them<br />Of Eros and of dust,<br />Beleaguered by the same<br />Negation and despair,<br />Show an affirming flame.<br /><br />----<br />-Click <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auden">here</a> to check out Auden's Wikipedia entry, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Collected-Poems-Modern-Library-Auden/dp/0679643508/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-1451796-3742421?ie=UTF8&s=books&amp;qid=1178245746&amp;sr=8-1">here</a> to buy his collected poems.<div class="blogger-post-footer">---
