My latest op-ed, <a href="http://mises.org/daily/5419/Lying-about-Libya">"Lying about Libya,"</a> appeared today in <i>Mises Daily</i>, a publication of the <a href="http://mises.org/daily/5419/Lying-about-Libya">Ludwig von Mises Institute</a>. &nbsp;You can read the article <a href="http://mises.org/daily/5419/Lying-about-Libya">here</a>.  In it, I write:<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-OSqQaB4n0OI/ThIpiCkqabI/AAAAAAAABDo/neK15FX9j-Y/s1600/LibyaOnGlobe.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-OSqQaB4n0OI/ThIpiCkqabI/AAAAAAAABDo/neK15FX9j-Y/s320/LibyaOnGlobe.jpg" width="229" /></a></div><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-small;">"What was sold to the American public as a humanitarian intervention morphed almost immediately into unreserved support of one side in Libya's civil war and a commitment to overthrowing Libya's existing government.</span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-small;">...</span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-small;">To decide whether a military action undertaken in our name is prudent and just, we must adopt a skeptical stance toward politicians' stories and rationalizations. We must attempt to see through these to the reality of the situation.</span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-small;"><br /></span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-small;">Stories can change, and new excuses can be spun, but once a war is launched there is no predicting the course it will take or the consequences it will have. Wars rarely go according to plan; they set in motion a course of events that no one person or group of people can hope to control."</span><br /><br /><a href="http://mises.org/daily/5419/Lying-about-Libya">Click here</a> to read the entire article.
