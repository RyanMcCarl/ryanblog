A great American public intellectual has died: Richard John Neuhaus, the founding editor of <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;"><a href="http://firstthings.com/">First Things</a>.  </span>Neuhaus was a liberal Lutheran minister active in the Civil Rights and antiwar movements of the 1960s who converted to Roman Catholicism and became a staunch, vocal social conservative.  I disagreed with him about most things, but I have the highest respect for his talents as a writer, and <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">First Things</span> is the best conservative magazine available on the intersection of religion and culture.  (Recommended liberal religious magazines: <a href="http://www.christiancentury.org/">Christian Century</a>, <a href="http://tikkun.org/">Tikkun</a>, and <a href="http://sojourners.com/">Sojourners</a>).<div class="blogger-post-footer">---
