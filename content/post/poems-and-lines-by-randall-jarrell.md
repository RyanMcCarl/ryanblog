<strong><em>From </em>The Orient Express</strong><br /><br />One looks from the train<br />Almost as one looked as a child.  In the sunlight<br />What I see still seems to me plain,<br />I am safe; but at evening<br />As the lands darken, a questioning<br />Precariousness comes over everything.<br /><br /><strong><em>From </em>Deutsch Durch Freud</strong><br /><br />Have you too sometimes, by the fire, at evening,<br />Wished that you were - whatever you once were?<br /><br /><strong><em>From </em>A Girl in a Library</strong><br /><br />An object among dreams, you sit here with your shoes off<br />And curl your legs up under you; your eyes<br />Close for a moment, your face moves toward sleep...<br />You are very human.<br />...<br />One sees it, in the glass, in one's own eyes.<br />In rooms alone, in galleries, in libraries,<br />In tears, in searchings of the heart, in staggering joys<br />We memorize once more our old creation,<br />Humanity: with what yawns the unwilling<br />Flesh puts on its spirit, O my sister!<br /><br /><em>From </em><strong>Aging</strong><br /><br />I wake, but before I know it it is done,<br />The day, I sleep.  And of days like these the years,<br />A life is made.  I nod, consenting to my life.<br /><br /><strong>The Meteorite</strong><br /><br />Star, that looked so long among the stones<br />And picked from them, half iron and half dirt,<br />One; and bent and put it to her lips<br />And breathed upon it till at last it burned<br />Uncertainly, among the stars its sisters -<br />Breathe on me still, star, sister.<div class="blogger-post-footer">---
