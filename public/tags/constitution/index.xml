      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was sorting through some books in my closet yesterday, and I discovered a fantastic book which drew me away from my regular reading: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Douglas-Letters-Selections-Private-Justice/dp/0917561465&#34;&gt;The Douglas Letters: Selections from the Private Papers of William O. Douglas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, edited by Melvin I. Urkofsky.  William O. Douglas was a brilliant, contrarian Associate Justice on the Supreme Court as well as a transformative environmentalist and New Dealer who crusaded against rampant speculation and corruption in the financial industry.  His writing is insightful and often hilarious.  Here are a few samples:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;To &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsey_Clark&#34;&gt;Ramsey Clark&lt;/a&gt;, 4/28/70:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my visit to Baghdad, I went to the University with my interpreter to see what books, if any, they had on our Constitution or Bill of Rights or Jefferson, Madison, democracy, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That library was bare on those subjects.  So when I returned, I prepared what I called the Douglas Eight Foot Shelf which I thought should be in every underdeveloped nation.  I thought then - and still think - that those ideas are more important than military missions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;To Max Radin (professor at Berkeley Law School), 5/27/46:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;If you are willing, I will ask you to find me a law clerk each year&amp;hellip;.I need not only a bright chap, but also a hard-working fellow with a smell for facts as well as for law.  I do not want a hide-bound, conservative fellow.  What I want is a Max Radin - a fellow who can hold his own in these sophisticated circles and who is not going to end up as a stodgy, hide-bound lawyer.  I want the kind of fellow for whom this work would be an exhilaration, who will be going into teaching or into practice of the law for the purpose of promoting the public good.  I do not want to fill the big law offices of the country with my law clerks&amp;hellip;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;To the&lt;/em&gt; Wall Street Journal, 10/16/78&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name=&#39;more&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the Editors:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notice of my demise has been emanating from several sources recently, not least of which is your Journal.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please be advised that I am today joining the ranks of citizens known as octogenarians and I assure you that I was never in a position to be resurrected in order to achieve such standing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;To Edward L.R. Elson, 12/7/77:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;Concerning my funeral arrangements&amp;hellip;From my hobo days, I knew the famous songwriter Woody Guthrie who wrote a song called &amp;ldquo;This Land is Your Land, This Land is My Land.&amp;rdquo;  It reflects not a socialist dream of mine, but many of the freedoms that are explicit or implicit in the Constitution, such as the right to move from place to place to look for a job or establish a new home, and the right to move interstate without payment of a fee, as some states within the last thirty years have tried to impose.  In other words, it expresses the vagrancy issue as I have expressed it and as it has become in-grained in the law. (See my opinion in &lt;em&gt;Papachristou et al v. City of Jacksonville&lt;/em&gt;, 405 U.S. 156 [1972].)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.law.umich.edu/historyandtraditions/faculty/Faculty_Lists/Alpha_Faculty/Pages/PeterKWesten.aspx&#34;&gt;Peter K. Westen&lt;/a&gt; (Douglas&amp;rsquo; law clerk, now a highly-respected professor at the University of Michigan Law School), 10/1/68:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;(After chewing him out for various mistakes)&lt;/em&gt;: You might think these things over, because the first case we have to dispose of when I get back is the case of P.K. Westen.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&amp;mdash;

      <title>Quotes from Hugo Black and Lon L. Fuller</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every departure from the principles of the law&amp;rsquo;s inner morality is an affront to man&amp;rsquo;s dignity as a responsible agent.  To judge his actions by unpublished or retrospective laws, or to order him to do an act that is impossible, is to convey to him your indifference to his powers of self-determination.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;I believe that if we were forced to select the principle that supports and infuses all human aspiration we would find it in the objective of maintaining communication with our fellows.  &amp;hellip;How and when we accomplish communication with one another can expand or contract the boundaries of life itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lon_L._Fuller&#34;&gt;Lon L. Fuller&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;ndash;&lt;em&gt;The Morality of Law&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Court&amp;rsquo;s justification for consulting its own notions rather than following the original meaning of the Constitution, as I would, apparently is based on the belief of the majority of the Court that for this Court to be bound by the original meaning of the Constitution is an intolerable and debilitating evil; that our Constitution should not be &amp;ldquo;shackled to the political theory of a particular era,&amp;rdquo; and that to save the country from the original Constitution the Court must have constant power to renew it and keep it abreast of this Court&amp;rsquo;s more enlightened theories of what is best for our society. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to me that this is an attack not only on the great value of our Constitution itself but also on the concept of a written constitution which is to survive through the years as originally written unless changed through the amendment process which the Framers wisely provided. Moreover, when a &amp;ldquo;political theory&amp;rdquo; embodied in our Constitution becomes outdated, it seems to me that a majority of the nine members of this Court are not only without constitutional power but are far less qualified to choose a new constitutional political theory than the people of this country proceeding in the manner provided by Article V.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Justice Hugo Black&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;ndash;&lt;em&gt;Harper v. Virginia State Board of Education&lt;/em&gt; (dissent); 383 U.S. 663 (1966)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one may be compelled against his conscience to render war service involving the use of arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;em&gt;Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany&lt;/em&gt;, Article IV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot consider the Bill of Rights to be an outworn 18th Century &amp;lsquo;strait jacket&amp;rsquo; as the Twining opinion did. Its provisions may be thought outdated abstractions by some. And it is true that they were designed to meet ancient evils. But they are the same kind of human evils that have emerged from century to century wherever excessive power is sought by the few at the expense of the many. In my judgment the people of no nation can lose their liberty so long as a Bill of Rights like ours survives and its basic purposes are conscientiously interpreted, enforced and respected so as to afford continuous protection against old, as well as new, devices and practices which might thwart those purposes. I fear to see the consequences of the Court&amp;rsquo;s practice of substituting its own concepts of decency and fundamental justice for the language of the Bill of Rights as its point of departure in interpreting and enforcing that Bill of Rights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Justice Hugo Black&lt;br /&gt; &amp;ndash;&lt;em&gt;Adamson v. California&lt;/em&gt; (dissent); 332 U.S. 46 (1946) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;All excerpts from Lloyd,&lt;/em&gt; Introduction to Jurisprudence (4th ed., 1979).&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&amp;mdash;
