      Happy Independence Day! I&rsquo;ll be spending a lazy Fourth revelling in freedom from work, sitting on the back porch with my roommates, and reading like crazy.
Just discovered Anna Akhmatova, a Russian poet who wrote and published under the specter of Soviet communism and Stalinism; her husband of eleven years was shot in 1921 as a &ldquo;counter-revolutionary,&rdquo; her son and lover were arrested and sent to labor camps, and she herself was regularly persecuted and followed by the secret police.

      Overland to the Islands
Let&rsquo;s go - much as that dog goes,
intently haphazard. The
Mexican light on a day that
&lsquo;smells like autumn in Connecticut&rsquo;
makes iris ripples on his
black gleaming fur - and that too
is as one would desire - a radiance
consorting with the dance.
Under his feet
rocks and mud, his imagination, sniffing,
engaged in its perceptions - dancing
edgeways, there&rsquo;s nothing
the dog disdains on his way,

      It was a highly respectable street, where all the houses were exactly alike, and where business men of moderate means begot and reared large families of children, all of whom went to Sunday School and learned the shorter catechism, and were exactly alike as their homes, and of a piece with the monotony in which they lived. Paul never went up Cordelia Street without a shudder of loathing.

He lay still and closed his eyes and let the tide of realities wash over him.

      When You Are Old
When you are old and grey and full of sleep,
And nodding by the fire, take down this book,
And slowly read, and dream of the soft look
Your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;
How many loved your moments of glad grace,
And loved your beauty with love false or true,
But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,
And loved the sorrows of your changing face;

      I&rsquo;m working extremely hard and learning a lot by day, and running, reading, and spending time with my friends in the evening - it&rsquo;s a great program, and I have a lot to be grateful for. Lately I&rsquo;ve been reading the poems of Thomas Hardy, and he has become one of my favorites. Here are a few of the poems and lines that I&rsquo;ve especially liked so far:

      <p>To You</p>

<p>Stranger, if you passing meet me and desire to speak to me,
why should you not speak to me?
And why should I not speak to you?</p>

<p>Walt Whitman</p>

<p>From Non Sum Qualis Eram Bonae Sub Regno Cynarae
[The days when Cynara was queen will not return for me &ndash;Catullus]
I cried for madder music and for stronger wine,
But when the feast is finished and the lamps expire,</p>

      From In Milan
I could compose, right now, a song
On the taste of peaches, on September in Europe.
No one can accuse me of being without joy
Or of not noticing girls who pass by.
From A Treatise on Poetry
When they put a rope around my neck,
When they choke off my breath with a rope,
I&rsquo;ll turn around once, and what will I be?
When they give me an injection of phenol,

      <p>Mus√©e des Beaux Arts</p>

<p>About suffering they were never wrong,
The Old Masters: how well they understood
Its human position; how it takes place
While someone else is eating or opening a window or just walking dully along;
How when the aged are reverently, passionately waiting
For the miraculous birth, there always must be
Children who did not specially want it to happen, skating
On a pond at the edge of the wood:</p>

      My recent fascination with Korean poetry continues, and tonight I spent an hour or two reading Japanese poetry as well. Here&rsquo;s a small sample of what I found:
Deer
Sad creature, neck stretched out;
Dignified always, you say nothing at all.
With your crown so fragrant,
Yours was too noble a clan.
As you stare into the depths
And think of lost legends,
In overwhelming sadness, you turn your neck

      <p>From To think of time
Walt Whitman
To think how eager we are in building our houses,
To think others shall be just as eager and we quite indifferent.</p>

<p>From Whoever you are holding me now in hand
Walt Whitman
Carry me when you go forth over land or sea;
For thus merely touching you is enough, is best,
And thus touching you would I silently sleep and be carried eternally.</p>
