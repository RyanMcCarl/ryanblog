      From Transit
A woman I have never seen before
Steps from the darkness of her town-house door
At just that crux of time when she is made
So beautiful that she or time must fade.
-Richard Wilbur
From Journey of the Year 1694
I trudged alone far into Yoshino. The mountains truly stretch on and on, and white clouds lie piled on the peaks. A smoky rain buried the valleys, here and there interrupted by the huts of the mountain folk, very small.

      As we would expect, during most wars consumer spending is deliberately held back by heavy taxes to make room for swelling military expenditure. During World War II, for example, consumption was squeezed back by heavy taxes to barely more than half of GDP. …During the Vietnam War military expenses for that conflict were not compensated by taxes to roll back consumption and the excess demand for goods and services ignited a subsequent inflation.

      <p>From How It Should Be in Heaven</p>

<p>How it should be in Heaven I know, for I was there.
By its river. Listening to its birds.
In its season: in summer, shortly after sunrise.
…
Peace eternal
Could have no mornings and no evenings,
Such a deficiency speaks against it.
And that’s too hard a nut for a theologian to crack.

A business that makes nothing but money is a poor kind of business.</p>

      An hour later, my thoughts are full of joy. Even little things affect me: a veil flutters on a hat, a lock of hair comes undone, two eyes close with laughter - and I am moved. Oh, this day, this day!
&hellip;
When you came, there was sympathy in your face and your eyes shone, you gave me your hand. Now your eyes are indifferent again. Am I mistaken?

      <p>He read no books, but his thoughts were often with God; it was natural, coming of simplicity and awe. The stars in the sky, the wind in the trees, the solitude and the wide-spreading snow, the might of earth and over earth filled him many times a day with a deep earnestness.

      A Short History
Corn planted us; tamed cattle made us tame.
Thence hut and citadel and kingdom came.
&ndash;Richard Wilbur
Let us not fool ourselves. What we knew is dead, and maybe the greatest part of what we were is dead. What&rsquo;s out there is perhaps good, but it&rsquo;s nothing we know.

The place of my origin had changed, and having gone away I had not changed with it.

He felt thankful, so he couldn&rsquo;t not believe in God.
From A Poetic State
Every minute the spectacle of the world astonishes me; it is so comic that I cannot understand how literature could expect to cope with it.</p>

What waiting in the halls,

break the heart.

      For whom, he thought, that splendor? For me alone?
Yet it will be here long after I perish.
-Czeslaw Milosz, from &ldquo;Study of Loneliness&rdquo;
Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for thereby some have entertained angels unawares. Remember those who are in prison, as though in prison with them; and those who are ill-treated, since you are also in the body.
-Hebrews 13:1-3
The behavior of individual consumers and producers in the rational pursuit of their objectives is governed by the principle of marginal utility, or marginality.

      You will hear thunder and remember me,
And think: she wanted storms. The rim
Of the sky will be the colour of hard crimson,
And your heart, as it was then, will be on fire.
That day in Moscow, it will all come true,
When, for the last time, I take my leave,
And hasten to the heights I have longed for,
Leaving my shadow still to be with you.
