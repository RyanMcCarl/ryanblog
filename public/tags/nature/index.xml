      <description>&lt;p&gt;Customs grow out of social processes whose details are highly individuated in regards to the type of activity, the individuals involved, their reputational pedigree, the knowledge they have about each other, and so on. &amp;nbsp;Viewing cultural evolution as deeply and densely rooted process may make one doubt the wisdom of government attempts to fine tune, guide, or supplant it. &amp;nbsp;It is highly unlikely that the blunt instruments of government will be well suited to cultivating the growth of delicate, teeming, unique interactions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daniel B. Klein&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;&amp;ldquo;Assurance and Trust in a Great Society.&amp;rdquo; &amp;nbsp;FEE Occasional Paper Two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kneeled to the crickets trilling&lt;br /&gt;underfoot as if about&lt;br /&gt;to burst from their crusty shells;&lt;br /&gt;and like a child again&lt;br /&gt;marveled to hear so clear&lt;br /&gt;and brave a music pour&lt;br /&gt;from such a small machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robert Penn Warren&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;i&gt;from&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;Touch Me&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name=&#39;more&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some assert that strict enforcement of contracts is really a way of showing respect for the dignity and freedom of other individuals by taking them at their word.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marvin A. Chirelstein&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;i&gt;Concepts and Case Analysis in the Law of Contracts&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look at her, touching his cheek&lt;br /&gt;to make a truce, her fingers&lt;br /&gt;cool with spring rain;&lt;br /&gt;in thin grass, bursts of purple crocus -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;even here, even at the beginning of love,&lt;br /&gt;her hand leaving his face makes&lt;br /&gt;an image of departure&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and they think&lt;br /&gt;they are free to overlook&lt;br /&gt;this sadness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Louise Gluck&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;i&gt;from&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;The Garden&amp;rdquo;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&amp;mdash;

alt=&#39;&#34; id=&#34;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5311272264829533522&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently finished Jim Harrison&amp;rsquo;s latest novel, &lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34; style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/English-Major-Novel-Jim-Harrison/dp/0802118631&#34;&gt;The English Major&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.  Harrison, a native of my home state of Michigan, is my favorite contemporary author, and &lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34; style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;The English Major &lt;/span&gt;is the best &amp;rdquo;fun read&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;ve had in a long time.  In trademark Harrison style, it is both hilarious and poignant, and it contains some great passages.  Excerpts below.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt;I tried to dismiss a pinprick of homesickness beneath my breastbone but then thought that homesickness like marital love was mostly a habit.  What I missed was no longer there or on the verge of disappearing.  I mean Lola was in dog heaven and the farm which had been sold to a stockbroker and his family from Chicago was to become a horse operation.  The barn and my cozy workshop would likely be remodeled into stables, the orchard uprooted for pasture, and our old home razed in favor of what Viv said would be &amp;ldquo;French provincial&amp;rdquo; whatever that was.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt;Dad once warned me about this when I was mourning the loss of a girlfriend to a quarterback.  I was a lonely lineman.  I moped and moped, and then when we were cutting wood on an icy October morning he told me that self-pity was a ruinous emotion.  &amp;rdquo;Look at the world, not up your ass,&amp;rdquo; he said.  It took me awhile to figure this out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34; style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt;She also liked to say that my dead father would wish me to be a &amp;ldquo;success&amp;rdquo; when my dad never spoke about such things except to say that successful people never had much time for important things like hunting, fishing, drinking, and wandering around in the woods.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt;Dad certainly wouldn&amp;rsquo;t own a cell phone which only made the wandering man a target with the number providing a guaranteed bull&amp;rsquo;s-eye.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt;Up to this point I hadn&amp;rsquo;t questioned the rightness of my trip but suddenly I wondered if I were truly suited for travel.  Reality seemed to be crumbling and I was wise enough to understand that reality stayed the same so it was my mind that was crumbling.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt;To my dad who was a young man during the Great Depression the only truly hopeless greivance was not to have a job, or not to have &amp;ldquo;work&amp;rdquo; as he called it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sort of neutral in terms of religion but ever since I was a kid I&amp;rsquo;ve thought moving water to be the best thing God made.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt;Everyone pretty much pans out in the middle ground or less.  In college I thought I was destined to go overseas but I didn&amp;rsquo;t.  We don&amp;rsquo;t quite get started except on our livelihood which is probably the story of mankind.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Jim Harrison&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;  &amp;ndash;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;

Of these at least no one can deprive him, though both the prosperity of world war and the fulfilment of important people&amp;rsquo;s ideals have proved to be no more than a cloud of dust that has swirled up to obscure the lone worker&amp;rsquo;s vision.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;To be able to look forward is to live.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Human life isn&amp;rsquo;t long enough for a peasant to become a man of means.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;He had never asked for any other joy than the joy of knowing that the sheep were breeding with good result in their regular season, and of seeing them weather the winter strong enough to struggle out of the bogs in spring.  Perhaps that is the true joy.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;And yet he did not find the happiness he had dreamed of, nor the peace he had so much desired, and she understood him, and loved him for that very reason, that he had found neither happiness nor peace.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;And to be able to look forward to the morrow in joyful expectation is good fortune indeed.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;They groped involuntarily for one another&amp;rsquo;s hand, fearful that they might be alone; what more was it really possible to do?  Thus they stood, holding hands and shivering as the moon disappeared into a deeper and deeper gloom; they were wanting coffee, they were cold.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Halldor Laxness&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;em&gt;Independent People&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Sjálfstætt fólk&lt;/em&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&amp;mdash;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;From Brad Leithauser&amp;rsquo;s introduction to Halldor Laxness&amp;rsquo; novel &lt;em&gt;Independent People&lt;/em&gt;: &amp;ldquo;There are good books and there are great books and there may be a book that is something still more: it is the book of your life. &amp;hellip;One looks differently on the book of genius that, even in a long bookworm&amp;rsquo;s life, one might not have stumbled upon.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excerpts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34; style=&#34;font-size: small;&#34;&gt;But higher than all dealers and societies stand the dreams of the heart, especially in the autumn when dusk is falling and the clouds of the world are full of marvellous pictures&amp;hellip;.Oh, that it may never end; that it might live on to eternity in the restless splendour of its color. And thus night after night she sat watching the silent music of the clouds.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;This was the first time that her soul was charmed by the power of poetry, which shows us the lot of man so truthfully and so sympathetically and with so much love for that which is good that we ourselves become better persons and understand life more fully than before, and hope and trust that good may always prevail in the life of man.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;The varied life implicit in all this noise affected the bewildered child with a sad sense of her own isolation, her own insignificance; she stood outside the boundaries of life.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;His being had rested full of adoration for the glory which unifies all distances in such beauty and sorrow that one no longer wishes for anything - in inconquerable adversity, in unquenchable longing, he felt that life had nevertheless been worth living.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;When life is a weariness and escape impossible, it is wonderful to have a friend who can bring us peace with the touch of a hand.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Presently the smell of coffee began to fill the room. This was morning&amp;rsquo;s hallowed moment. In such a fragrance the perversity of the world is forgotten and the soul is inspired with faith in the future; when all was said and done, it was probably true that there really were far-off places, even foreign countries.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Few things are so inconstant, so unstable, as a loving heart, and yet it is the only place in the world where one can find sympathy.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;No one will ever be able to say that Bjartur of Summerhouses ever got the worst of it in his world war with the country&amp;rsquo;s spectres, no matter how often he might tumble over a precipice or roll head over heels down a gully - &amp;ldquo;while there&amp;rsquo;s a breath left in my nostrils, it will never keep me down, however hard it blows.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;She lay like this for a long time, still quivering and still with a pain in her heart; no memories could comfort her any longer, terror is stronger than the total sum of anyone&amp;rsquo;s happiness. She tried to think with hope of the far-off dawn, for human beings always seek some source of consolation; it is this search for consolation, even when every retreat is obviously cut off, that proves that one is still alive.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;But the high heath had also a value for this man other than the practical and the economic. It was his spiritual mother, his church, his better world, as the ocean must inevitably be to the seafarer. When he walked along over the moors on the clear, frosty days of late autumn, when he ran his eyes over the desert&amp;rsquo;s pathless range and felt the cold clean breeze of the mountains on his face, then he too would prove the substance of patriotic song.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;He gazed out the window for a while, without accounting for the trend of his thought, staring in silence towards the mountain.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;For you are all of the same high birth: God&amp;rsquo;s children all of you.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Take my word for it, freedom is of more account than the height of a roof beam.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, whatever a man seeks he will find - in his dog.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&amp;mdash;

      <title>Excerpts from Milosz, Balthasar, and Stevens</title>
      <link>http://ryanmccarl.com/post/excerpts-from-milosz-balthasar-and-stevens/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Among the many definitions of Communism, perhaps one would be the most apt: enemy of orchards. For the disappearance of villages and the remodeling of the terrain necessitated cutting down the orchards once surrounding every house and hut. The idea of collective farming - grain factories instead of little peasant lots - was rational, but with a vengeance, and a similar vengeance lurking in practically every project of the planned economy brought about the downfall of the Soviet system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Orchards under Communism had no chance, but in all fairness let us concede that they are antique by their very nature. Only the passion of a gardener can delight in growing a great variety of trees, each producing a small crop of fruit whose tastes pleases the gardener himself and a few connoisseurs. Market laws favor a few species that are easy to preserve and correspond to basic standards.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Much was going on inside me, and I was stunned by the strength of that current for which no name seemed adequate. It was like waking up from a long dream and becoming again the person whom I have never ceased to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Czeslaw Milosz&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;&amp;ldquo;Happiness&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One would like to astound the world, to save the world, but one can do neither. We are summoned to deeds that are of moment only to our village.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Czeslaw Milosz&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;&amp;ldquo;Who Was I?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I am not wise, then why must I pretend to be? If I am lost, why must I pretend to have ready counsel for my contemporaries? But perhaps the value of communication depends on the acknowledgment of one&amp;rsquo;s own limits, which, mysteriously, are also limits common to many others; and aren&amp;rsquo;t these the same limits of a hundred or a thousand years ago? And when the air is filled with the clamor of analysis and conclusion, would it be entirely useless to admit you do not understand?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read many books, but to place all those volumes on top of one another and stand on them would not add a cubit to my stature. Their learned terms are of little use when I try to seize naked experience, which eludes all accepted ideas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Czeslaw Milosz&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;&amp;ldquo;My Intention&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The man who stakes his all on this one thing wins all, but he must of course reckon with the loss of everything else excluded by this one thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hans Urs von Balthasar&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;em&gt;The Moment of Christian Witness&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why should she give her bounty to the dead?&lt;br /&gt;What is divinity if it can come&lt;br /&gt;Only in silent shadows and in dreams?&lt;br /&gt;Shall she not find in comforts of the sun,&lt;br /&gt;In pungent fruit and bright green wings, or else&lt;br /&gt;In any balm or beauty of the earth,&lt;br /&gt;Things to be cherished like the thought of heaven?&lt;br /&gt;Divinity must live within herself:&lt;br /&gt;Passions of rain, or moods in falling snow;&lt;br /&gt;Grievings in loneliness, or unsubdued&lt;br /&gt;Elations when the forest blooms; gusty&lt;br /&gt;Emotions on wet roads on autumn nights;&lt;br /&gt;All pleasures and all pains, remembering&lt;br /&gt;The bough of summer and the winter branch.&lt;br /&gt;These are the measures destined for her soul.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Shall our blood fail?

      <title>Quotes from Jim Harrison&#39;s &#39;True North&#39;</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The main feature of the Kingston Plains was the thousands of acres of white pine stumps, some of them very large, which had been cut at waist or chest height probably during the winter when it was easier to skid the trees out on snow-covered trails which they dampened to form ice so that the draft horse-drawn log sleighs could be more easily pulled. &amp;hellip;I swiveled around until I had completed a 360-degree view, suppressing any anger I felt over the idea that they might have left a few trees for those in the future to look at. Maybe to try to imagine the trees was like asking a contemporary Lakota to imagine a million buffalo.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;It occurred to me that you could explain everything away but the behavior remained.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Frankly I wanted to be useful in this life and that could be defined only by work, not good intentions.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;I felt absurdly happy when I entered Michigan just north of Toledo, though I was already lonely for Riva.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Being at the university through the deaths of Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. ending with the more recent Kent State butchery had often made academic studies seem problematical and remote. How upsetting to see your professor break down in tears in your Chaucer class the day after King was murdered. My return to religion was a defense against the insanity of the time, a way to avoid standing there simply screaming like the girl in the famous Kent State photograph. I recalled the day when I was a junior at Michigan State and Cynthia had called to say that she had heard our ex-paper boy had died in Vietnam. He was a poor kid and never seemed dressed warmly enough in winter when below-zero winds blew in off Lake Superior. &amp;hellip;He put a face on an insane war.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;How soiled and tawdry poor Jesus was compared to the theological school where the self-interest of the human intelligence smothered prayer, and the abstractions in the history of theology were a virtual fire extinguisher on the Gospels.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Every location has its classic Greek chorus muttering, chattering, moaning in the background.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Fred says that when he sees a politician who has further crushed the poor pray in public he wants to pick up a gun.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;I was cold and exhausted and went back to the motel room, drew an easy chair up to the window, then fell asleep staring at the frightening whiteness of the world. It was clearly a blank canvas on which you could paint your life if you cared to. Just before sleep I imagined sitting at the cabin window and painted the interior of what would be my cabin, including the front window from which the only visible thing was Lake Superior and the line of the horizon, but there was the nagging idea Fred had explained that as a putative Christian I had to learn how to function in the world before I earned the right to retreat.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;We were jittery when we rigged our fly rods and flipped a coin for the first cast. Glenn won and caught a two-pounder and then it became apparent that the fish weren&amp;rsquo;t gun-shy so we could both cast. We caught a dozen before dark and released all but two which we kept for a midnight snack and ate with a six-pack of beer Glenn had stowed in the cold creek. The northern lights were astounding, whirling sheets and cones of rose and green and bluish lights so strong they gave off a tinny metallic sound.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Naturally during the act of love you&amp;rsquo;re undisturbed by reality, a grace note I also found in trout fishing, but then lovemaking and fishing don&amp;rsquo;t manage to dominate your life like you wished they could.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;We gave up our heavy talk and spent two days rowing. In my own life strength has come from unfolding, subtracting, rather than adding.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Clarence said a striking thing about rowing that I&amp;rsquo;ve always valued, the upshot of which was that he liked rowing because you were approaching life backward. You could clearly see the past, and you glanced quickly at the future over your shoulder mostly so you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t run into anything destructively immovable. Too much of the future was predestined by the behavior of others for you to be in control. The most you could hope for is to be ready and attentive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jim Harrison&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/True-North-Jim-Harrison/dp/0802142060/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1202245476&amp;amp;sr=8-2&#34;&gt;True North&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;(I picked up&lt;/em&gt; True North&lt;em&gt; at the Dawn Treader Book Shop (one of my favorites) in Ann Arbor, MI yesterday, and it has sucked me in and engrossed me in a way that hasn&amp;rsquo;t happened in awhile.  I read 50 pages in one sitting last night and another 150 pages on the train from Ann Arbor to Chicago this morning.  I don&amp;rsquo;t know how it ends yet, but it&amp;rsquo;s highly recommended.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&amp;mdash;

      <title>Quotes from Hamsun, Krakauer, and Campbell</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;He wanders eastward, toward the sun, he comes to a mountain.  A voice calls: are you near a mountain?  Yes, he answers, I&amp;rsquo;m standing near a mountain.  Then the voice says: That mountain you are standing near is my foot; I am lying bound in the uttermost part of the earth, come set me free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later, when he came to think about it, he acknowledged that those hours had had a significance for him that no one could realize, and if it was true - as had just been said - that at times his writing &lt;span style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;sparkled&lt;/span&gt;, then it was his memories of that time that had kindled the spark; it was a reflection of the happiness his two playmates had bestowed on him in his childhood.  For that reason they could claim a large share in his achievements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But his days varied, the good alternating with the bad, and sometimes he would be working at his best when a thought, a pair of eyes, a word from the past would strike him, quenching his inspiration.  Then he would get up and begin to pace his room from wall to wall; he had done this so often, he had worn a white path across the floor, and the path grew daily whiter&amp;hellip;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knut Hamsun&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;Victoria&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so it turned out that only a life similar to the life of those around us, merging with it without a ripple, is genuine life, and that an unshared happiness is not happiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boris Pasternak&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;Doctor Zhivago&lt;/span&gt; (quoted in Krakauer, &lt;span style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;Into the Wild&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I was alone, however, even the mundane seemed charged with meaning.  The ice looked colder and more mysterious, the sky a cleaner shade of blue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is easy, when you are young, to believe that what you desire is no less than what you deserve, to assume that if you want something badly enough, it is your God-given right to have it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jon Krakauer&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;Into the Wild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The universal triumph of the secular state has thrown all religious organizations into such a definitely secondary, and finally ineffectual, position that religious pantomime is hardly more today than a sanctimonious exercise for Sunday morning, whereas business ethics and patriotism stand for the remainder of the week.  Such a monkey-holiness is not what the functioning world requires&amp;hellip;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A single song is being inflected through all the colorations of the human choir.  General propaganda for one or another of the local solutions is superfluous - or much rather, a menace.  The way to become human is to learn to recognize the lineaments of God in all of the wonderful modulations of the face of man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joseph Campbell&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;The Hero With a Thousand Faces&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&amp;mdash;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;He read no books, but his thoughts were often with God; it was natural, coming of simplicity and awe. The stars in the sky, the wind in the trees, the solitude and the wide-spreading snow, the might of earth and over earth filled him many times a day with a deep earnestness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knut Hamsun&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;em&gt;Growth of the Soil&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;From &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dante&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He did not return, even after his death, to&lt;br /&gt;That ancient city he was rooted in.&lt;br /&gt;Going away, he did not pause for breath&lt;br /&gt;Nor look back. My song is for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anna Akhmatova&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;From &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Heaven and Earth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so I cross into another world&lt;br /&gt;shyly and in homage linger for an invitation&lt;br /&gt;from this unknown that I would trespass on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very glad, and all alone in the world,&lt;br /&gt;all alone, and very glad, in a new world&lt;br /&gt;where I am disembarked at last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For when it is quite, quite nothing, then it is everything.&lt;br /&gt;When I am trodden quite out, quite, quite out,&lt;br /&gt;every vestige gone, then I am here&lt;br /&gt;risen, and setting my foot on another world&lt;br /&gt;risen, not born again, but risen, body the same as before,&lt;br /&gt;new beyond knowledge of newness, alive beyond life,&lt;br /&gt;proud beyond inkling or furthest conception of pride,&lt;br /&gt;living where life was never yet dreamed of, nor hinted at,&lt;br /&gt;here, in the other world, still terrestrial&lt;br /&gt;myself, the same as before, yet unaccountably new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ah no, I cannot tell you what it is, the new world.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot tell you the mad, astounded rapture of its discovery.&lt;br /&gt;I shall be mad with delight before I have done,&lt;br /&gt;and whosoever comes after will find me in the new world&lt;br /&gt;a madman in rapture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;D.H. Lawrence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And in the night, he lay wanting her, and she was willing. She did not go away next morning; all that day she did not go, but helped about the place; milked the goats, and scoured pots and things with fine sand, and got them clean. She did not go away at all. Inger was her name. And Isak was his name. &amp;hellip; She did not run away. When he had been out, and came home again, there was Inger at the hut; the two were one, the woman and the hut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ho, they were getting well-to-do, with this hut of theirs, this farm of theirs; why, &amp;lsquo;twas good enough for anyone. Aye, they&amp;rsquo;d as good as all they could wish for already. Oh, that Inger; he loved her and she loved him again; they were frugal folk; they lived in primitive wise, and lacked for nothing. &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s go to sleep!&amp;rdquo; And they went to sleep. And wakened in the morning to another day, with things to look at, matters to see to, once again; aye, toil and pleasure, ups and downs, the way of life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knut Hamsun&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;em&gt;Growth of the Soil&lt;/em&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&amp;mdash;

I am stunned at how beautiful &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knut_Hamsun&#34;&gt;Knut Hamsun&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s writing is, and cannot believe that he is not a household name in America. He was a very flawed man - like Martin Heidegger, Carl Schmitt, and too many others, he abused his considerable intellectual gifts in support of Nazism, and it is understandable that this removed his right to a full place in the Great Books pantheon. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the same, however, he is an incredible writer whose work deserves to be a standard on classics lists. &lt;em&gt;Pan &lt;/em&gt;was a truly special read, and I am going to read as many of his novels as I can get my hands on. Here are some excerpts to give you a taste:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a big, white-washed house down by the sea, I met someone who for a short while filled my thoughts. She is no longer always in my memory, not now - no, I have quite forgotten her. But I do recall the other things, the cries of the sea birds, the hunting in the forest, my nights, and all the warm hours of the summer. It was in any case by sheer chance that I met her; and had it not been for that chance she would never have lain in my thoughts for a single day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For it is within ourselves that the sources of joy and sorrow lie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a boulder outside my hut, a big grey boulder. It always seemed by its expression to be well-disposed towards me; it was as if it saw me as I came past and knew me again. I used to like making my way past this boulder when I went out in the mornings, and it was as though I left a good friend there who would be waiting when I got back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some days a chill atmosphere of unrest hung over the earth; rotten branches snapped and the crows collected in flocks and squawked. But it was not for long, the sun was near; one morning it rose up behind the forest. A sweet pang strikes through me when the sun comes; I throw my gun on my shoulder in silent rejoicing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed every bend, taking my time; there was no hurry and nobody was waiting for me at home. Free as a king I went my way in the peace of the forest, as leisurely as I pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everywhere the sky was open and pure. I gazed into the clear sea and it was as if I lay face to face with the depths of the earth, and as if my beating heart went out to those depths and was at home there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;More excerpts to come; all of the above beauties were in the first ten pages of the 192 page book. A &lt;/em&gt;New Yorker&lt;em&gt; article about Hamsun can be found &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/12/26/051226crat_atlarge&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and the book can be purchased &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Pan-Knut-Hamsun/dp/1406937932/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-0086905-3665754?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1186303891&amp;amp;sr=8-1&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If the stars should appear one night in a thousand years, how would men believe and adore, and preserve for many generations the remembrance of the city of God which had been shown!  But every night come out these envoys of beauty, and light the universe with their admonishing smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Broad moon shall be my England of the senses and the understanding; the night shall be my Germany of mystic philosophy and dreams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is a farm but a mute gospel?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a higher manner, the poet communicates the same pleasure.  By a few strokes, he delineates, as on air, the mountain, the camp, the city, the hero, the maiden, not different from what we know them, but only lifted from the ground and afloat before the eye.  He unfixes the land and the sea, makes them revolve around the axis of his primary thought, and disposes them anew.&lt;br /&gt;…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The aspect of nature is devout.  Like the figure of Jesus, she stands with bended head, and hands folded upon the breast.  The happiest man is he who learns from nature the lesson of worship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Shakespeare’s “Tempest,” excerpted in Emerson’s &lt;span style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;Nature&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;   The charm dissolves apace,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;And, as the morning steals upon the night,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;Melting the darkness, so their rising senses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;Begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;Their clearer reason.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;   Their understanding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;Begins to swell: and the approaching tide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;Will shortly fill the reasonable shores&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;That now lie foul and muddy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are associated in adolescent and adult life with some friends who, like skies and waters, are coextensive with our idea; who, answering each to a certain affection of the soul, satisfy our desire on that side; whom we lack power to put at such focal distance from us, that we can mend or even analyze them.  We cannot choose but love them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore is nature ever the ally of Religion: lends all her pomp and riches to the religious sentiment.  Prophet and priest, David, Isaiah, Jesus, have drawn deeply from this source.  This ethical character so penetrates the bone and marrow of nature, as to seem the end for which it was made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The poet, the orator, bred in the woods, whose senses have been nourished by their fair and appeasing changes, year after year, without design and without heed, shall not lose their lesson altogether, in the roar of cities or the broil of politics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tradesman, the attorney comes out of the din and craft of the street, and sees the sky and the woods, and is a man again.  In their eternal calm, he finds himself.  The health of the eye seems to demand a horizon.  We are never tired, so long as we can see far enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see the spectacle of morning from the hill-top over against my house, from daybreak to sunrise, with emotions which an angel might share.  The long slender bars of cloud float like fishes in the sea of crimson light.  From the earth as a shore, I look out into that silent sea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A man is fed, not that he may be fed, but that he may work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foregoing generations beheld God and nature face to face; we, through their eyes.  Why should not we also enjoy an original relation to the universe?  Why should not we have a poetry and philosophy of insight and not of tradition, and a religion by revelation to us, and not the history of theirs?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miller owns this field, Locke that, and Manning the woodland beyond.  But none of them owns the landscape.  There is a property in the horizon which no man has but he whose eye can integrate all the parts, that is, the poet.  This is the best part of these men’s farms, yet to this their warranty-deeds give no title.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the presence of nature, a wild delight runs through the man, in spite of real sorrows.  Nature says, he is my creature, and maugre all his impertinent griefs, he shall be glad with me.  Not the sun or the summer alone, but every hour and season yields its tribute of delight; for every hour and change corresponds to and authorizes a different state of the mind, from breathless noon to grimmest midnight.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&amp;mdash;
