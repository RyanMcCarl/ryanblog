      Customs grow out of social processes whose details are highly individuated in regards to the type of activity, the individuals involved, their reputational pedigree, the knowledge they have about each other, and so on. &nbsp;Viewing cultural evolution as deeply and densely rooted process may make one doubt the wisdom of government attempts to fine tune, guide, or supplant it. &nbsp;It is highly unlikely that the blunt instruments of government will be well suited to cultivating the growth of delicate, teeming, unique interactions.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      I recently finished Jim Harrison&rsquo;s latest novel, The English Major. Harrison, a native of my home state of Michigan, is my favorite contemporary author, and The English Major is the best &rdquo;fun read&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve had in a long time. In trademark Harrison style, it is both hilarious and poignant, and it contains some great passages. Excerpts below.
&hellip;I tried to dismiss a pinprick of homesickness beneath my breastbone but then thought that homesickness like marital love was mostly a habit.

      I recently finished Halldor Laxness&rsquo;s Independent People (Sjálfstætt fólk), and it was one of the top ten novels I have ever read.
A few more excerpts (I&rsquo;ve posted others here and here):
One has grown weary of one&rsquo;s house before it has finished building; strange that mankind should need to live in a house, instead of remaining content with the house of wishes.
&hellip;
Come what may and go what may, a man always has the memories of his dogs.

      From Brad Leithauser&rsquo;s introduction to Halldor Laxness&rsquo; novel Independent People: &ldquo;There are good books and there are great books and there may be a book that is something still more: it is the book of your life. &hellip;One looks differently on the book of genius that, even in a long bookworm&rsquo;s life, one might not have stumbled upon.&rdquo;
Excerpts:
But higher than all dealers and societies stand the dreams of the heart, especially in the autumn when dusk is falling and the clouds of the world are full of marvellous pictures&hellip;.

      Among the many definitions of Communism, perhaps one would be the most apt: enemy of orchards. For the disappearance of villages and the remodeling of the terrain necessitated cutting down the orchards once surrounding every house and hut. The idea of collective farming - grain factories instead of little peasant lots - was rational, but with a vengeance, and a similar vengeance lurking in practically every project of the planned economy brought about the downfall of the Soviet system.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      The main feature of the Kingston Plains was the thousands of acres of white pine stumps, some of them very large, which had been cut at waist or chest height probably during the winter when it was easier to skid the trees out on snow-covered trails which they dampened to form ice so that the draft horse-drawn log sleighs could be more easily pulled. &hellip;I swiveled around until I had completed a 360-degree view, suppressing any anger I felt over the idea that they might have left a few trees for those in the future to look at.

      He wanders eastward, toward the sun, he comes to a mountain. A voice calls: are you near a mountain? Yes, he answers, I&rsquo;m standing near a mountain. Then the voice says: That mountain you are standing near is my foot; I am lying bound in the uttermost part of the earth, come set me free!
&hellip;
Later, when he came to think about it, he acknowledged that those hours had had a significance for him that no one could realize, and if it was true - as had just been said - that at times his writing sparkled, then it was his memories of that time that had kindled the spark; it was a reflection of the happiness his two playmates had bestowed on him in his childhood.

      <p>He read no books, but his thoughts were often with God; it was natural, coming of simplicity and awe. The stars in the sky, the wind in the trees, the solitude and the wide-spreading snow, the might of earth and over earth filled him many times a day with a deep earnestness.

      I just finished the best novel I&rsquo;ve read in a very long time. I am stunned at how beautiful Knut Hamsun&rsquo;s writing is, and cannot believe that he is not a household name in America. He was a very flawed man - like Martin Heidegger, Carl Schmitt, and too many others, he abused his considerable intellectual gifts in support of Nazism, and it is understandable that this removed his right to a full place in the Great Books pantheon.

      If the stars should appear one night in a thousand years, how would men believe and adore, and preserve for many generations the remembrance of the city of God which had been shown! But every night come out these envoys of beauty, and light the universe with their admonishing smile.
…
Broad moon shall be my England of the senses and the understanding; the night shall be my Germany of mystic philosophy and dreams.
