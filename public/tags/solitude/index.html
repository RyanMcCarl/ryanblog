      Happy Thanksgiving weekend! I am spending it in Boulder, CO, one of the most beautiful cities in America.
From &ldquo;Static Poems&rdquo;
Deafness to imperatives
is profundity in the wise man,
children and grandchildren
don&rsquo;t bother him,
don&rsquo;t alarm him.
To represent a particular outlook,
to act,
to travel hither and yon
are all signs of a world
that doesn&rsquo;t see clearly.
&ndash;Gottfried Benn
(in Poetry, 11&frasl;09.)
Adult authoritarians tend to be highly ethnocentric and heavy users of the &ldquo;consensual validation pill&rdquo; (Newcomb, 1961).

      Goethe comments that the Church erred in closing the canon of scripture, as God&rsquo;s creative work still continues, notably in the activity of great spirits like Mozart, Raphael, and Shakespeare, &ldquo;who can draw their lesser contemporaries higher.&rdquo;
&hellip;
For the first time in history, authors of highly successful works can hope to have them translated into twenty or thirty languages within a few years of publication, and foreign countries may even provide the primary readership for writers who have small audiences at home or who are censored by their governments.

      I am more and more convinced that poetry is the universal possession of mankind&hellip;the epoch of world literature is at hand, and everyone must strive to hasten its approach.
&ndash;Goethe (quoted in Damrosch, What is World Literature?)
White Towels
I have been studying the difference
between solitude and loneliness,
telling the story of my life
to the clean white towels taken warm from the dryer.
I carry them through the house

      Even in mundane situations, the individual must act in order to discover what he is and he must act in order to continue experiencing aspects of himself which he values and enjoys. If he thinks of himself as a businessman, a parent, an athlete, an intellectual, he must engage in behavior appropriate to this self-image. If he does not, he must redefine himself, or he will be left feeling anxious and needful.

      He wanders eastward, toward the sun, he comes to a mountain. A voice calls: are you near a mountain? Yes, he answers, I&rsquo;m standing near a mountain. Then the voice says: That mountain you are standing near is my foot; I am lying bound in the uttermost part of the earth, come set me free!
&hellip;
Later, when he came to think about it, he acknowledged that those hours had had a significance for him that no one could realize, and if it was true - as had just been said - that at times his writing sparkled, then it was his memories of that time that had kindled the spark; it was a reflection of the happiness his two playmates had bestowed on him in his childhood.

      I don’t switch on the ceiling light at once but leave the room in twilight so the yellow flames in the stove flicker brightly over the floor and walls. The sight of them slows my breathing down and makes me calm as it must have done for men through thousands of years: let the wolves howl, here by the fire it’s safe.

But each time he came home he had changed a little, and I had to concentrate hard to hold on to him.

      <p>He read no books, but his thoughts were often with God; it was natural, coming of simplicity and awe. The stars in the sky, the wind in the trees, the solitude and the wide-spreading snow, the might of earth and over earth filled him many times a day with a deep earnestness.

      I just finished the best novel I&rsquo;ve read in a very long time. I am stunned at how beautiful Knut Hamsun&rsquo;s writing is, and cannot believe that he is not a household name in America. He was a very flawed man - like Martin Heidegger, Carl Schmitt, and too many others, he abused his considerable intellectual gifts in support of Nazism, and it is understandable that this removed his right to a full place in the Great Books pantheon.
