    <div class="article-style">
      
      Jonathan Glover&rsquo;s Humanity: A Moral History of the Twentieth Century is one of the best and most important books I have ever read. Excerpts below:
&mdash;
An extimate for the period from 1900 until 1989 is that war killed 86 million people. Eighty-six million is a small proportion of all those alive during the ninety years, and is a small number compared to those who have died from hunger and preventable diseases.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      I am currently reading Viktor Frankl&rsquo;s Man&rsquo;s Search for Meaning. Frankl, a psychiatrist, was imprisoned in the Nazi concentration camps, including Auschwitz, for several years. He survived the experience and went on to develop the theory of &ldquo;logotherapy,&rdquo; a branch of psychoanalysis that focuses on human beings&rsquo; &ldquo;will to meaning.&rdquo; The part of the book that discusses Frankl&rsquo;s memories of his camp experience is, like any Holocaust memoir worth its salt, extremely disturbing and difficult to read, but it ought to be read in spite of that.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      I recently finished Jim Harrison&rsquo;s latest novel, The English Major. Harrison, a native of my home state of Michigan, is my favorite contemporary author, and The English Major is the bestÂ &rdquo;fun read&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve had in a long time. In trademark Harrison style, it is both hilarious and poignant, and it contains some great passages. Excerpts below.
&hellip;I tried to dismiss a pinprick of homesickness beneath my breastbone but then thought that homesickness like marital love was mostly a habit.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      Happy New Year! At the end of each of the past three years, I&rsquo;ve written a post listing the best books I&rsquo;ve read over the course of the year in order to bring these books to the attention of others. My lists from 2007 and 2006 are available here and here.
As usual, I&rsquo;ve put the titles of the five books most important to me this year in bold, and I&rsquo;ve linked each book to its Amazon.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      Excerpts from Richard Layard&rsquo;s Happiness: Lessons from a New Science:
The extra happiness provided by extra income is greatest when you are poor, and declines steadily as you get richer.
&hellip;
&ldquo;Required income&rdquo; varies strongly with the actual income that an individual currently experiences. A dollar rise in experienced income causes a rise of at least a forty cents in &ldquo;required income.&rdquo; So when I earn an extra dollar this year, it makes me happier, but next year I shall measure my income from a benchmark that is forty cents higher.

      Even in mundane situations, the individual must act in order to discover what he is and he must act in order to continue experiencing aspects of himself which he values and enjoys. If he thinks of himself as a businessman, a parent, an athlete, an intellectual, he must engage in behavior appropriate to this self-image. If he does not, he must redefine himself, or he will be left feeling anxious and needful.

      He who refuses to embrace a unique opportunity loses the prize as surely as if he tried and failed.
&hellip;
Our errors are surely not such awfully solemn things. In a world where we are so certain to incur them in spite of all our caution, a certain lightness of heart seems healthier than this excessive nervousness on their behalf.
&hellip;
Let us give the name hypothesis to anything that may be proposed to our belief; and just as the electricians speak of live and dead wires, let us speak of any hypothesis as either live or dead.

      The achievements of the past provide the only means at command for understanding the present. &hellip;The institutions and customs that exist in the present and that give rise to present social ills and dislocations did not arise overnight. They have a long history behind them. Attempt to deal with them simply on the basis of what is obvious in the present is bound to result in adoption of superficial measures which in the end will only render existing problems more acute and more difficult to solve.

      He wanders eastward, toward the sun, he comes to a mountain. A voice calls: are you near a mountain? Yes, he answers, I&rsquo;m standing near a mountain. Then the voice says: That mountain you are standing near is my foot; I am lying bound in the uttermost part of the earth, come set me free!
&hellip;
Later, when he came to think about it, he acknowledged that those hours had had a significance for him that no one could realize, and if it was true - as had just been said - that at times his writing sparkled, then it was his memories of that time that had kindled the spark; it was a reflection of the happiness his two playmates had bestowed on him in his childhood.
