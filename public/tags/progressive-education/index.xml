      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons policymakers seek to impose detailed curriculum mandates.  They may fundamentally distrust educators: Much of the current standards movement is just the latest episdoe in a long, sorry history of trying to create a teacher-proof curriculum.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;These days almost anything can be done to students and to schools, no matter how ill-considered, as long as it is done in the name of raising standards.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s convenient for us to assume that kids who cut corners are just being lazy, because then it&amp;rsquo;s the kids who have to be fixed.  But perhaps they&amp;rsquo;re just being rational.  They have adapted to an environment where results, not intellectual exploration, are what count.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Assessment is used less to support learning than to evaluate and compare people.  &amp;hellip;(Standardized testing) screens and sorts students for the convenience of industry (and higher education).&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;What happens to schools when they are plunged into the marketplace?  To begin with, they must shift much of their time and resources to, well, marketing.  (It is those who sell themselves skillfully, not those who are especially good at what they do, who tend to succeed in a competitive market.)  Moreover, the pressure to make themselves look better presents a temptation to screen out less desirable students, those whose education takes more effort or expense.  &amp;ldquo;The problem with public schools,&amp;rdquo; remarked author John Chubb, &amp;ldquo;is that they must take whoever walks in the door.&amp;rdquo;  The philosophical core of the privatization movement for which Chubb speaks is neatly revealed in the use of the word &lt;em&gt;problem &lt;/em&gt;in that sentence.  &lt;em&gt;[Note: I disagree with this statement, but it is the among the best anti-voucher arguments I&amp;rsquo;ve seen.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alfie Kohn&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;ndash;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Educated-Essays-Standards-Grading-Follies/dp/0807032670&#34;&gt;What Does it Mean to Be Well Educated?&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;(Highly recommended.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, thanking Mr. Ramsay for it and Mrs. Ramsay for it and the hour and the place, crediting the world with a power which she had not suspected - that one could walk away down that long gallery not alone any more but arm in arm with somebody - the strangest feeling in the world, and the most exhilarating&amp;hellip;.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Here she saddened, darkened, and came back to her chair, there could be no disputing this: an unmarried woman (she lightly took her hand for a moment), an unmarried woman has missed the best of life.  The house seemed full of children sleeping and Mrs. Ramsay listening; shaded lights and regular breathing.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;How strangely he was venerable and laughable at one and the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;She bore about with her, she could not help knowing it, the torch of her beauty; she carried it erect into any room that she entered; and after all, veil it as she might, and shrink from the monotony of bearing that it imposed on her, her beauty was apparent.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;The very stone one kicks with one&amp;rsquo;s boot will outlast Shakespeare.  His own little light would shine, not very brightly, for a year or two, and would then be merged in some bigger light, and that in a bigger still.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;All at once he realised that it was this: it was this: - she was the most beautiful person he had ever seen.  &amp;hellip;For the first time in his life Charles Tansley felt an extraordinary pride; a man digging in a drain stopped digging and looked at her, let his arm fall down and looked at her; for the first time in his life Charles Tansley felt an extraordinary pride; felt the wind and the cyclamen and the violets for he was walking with a beautiful woman.  He had hold of her bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Virginia Woolf&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;ndash;&lt;em&gt;To the Lighthouse&lt;/em&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&amp;mdash;

      <title>The case for a School of Education at the University of Chicago</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;rsquo;s unsigned &lt;a href=&#34;http://maroon.uchicago.edu/online_edition/viewpoints/2007/11/02/a-failing-grade/&#34;&gt;editorial&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Chicago&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Maroon&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The University of Chicago is often referred to as the “Teacher of Teachers.” U of C graduates tend to go into academia at much higher rates than do those at peer schools, and many of the ideas associated with the University—the “Life of the Mind,” “Chicago Math,” and “progressive education,” for example—are directly relevant to the challenges faced by America’s K–12 schools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having benefited from a great education, many Chicago students would appreciate the opportunity to introduce the next generation of students to the world of ideas. Unfortunately, their desire to do so runs headlong into a system that discourages them from teaching in public schools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was not always the case. John Dewey, arguably the greatest educational theorist of the 20th century, started the U of C’s School of Education in 1895. The program was allowed to deteriorate until it was finally shut down in 2001. Students in the College now have no way to earn teaching certification or study the discipline of education during their undergraduate years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each year, many U of C graduates enter Teach for America or other alternative certification programs. Such programs tend to send recent graduates to the toughest, most disadvantaged schools in the country, with minimal training. Although many graduates are able to rise to this challenge, the high turnover rate shows that these programs are not appropriate for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;U of C students who want to teach generally must choose between alternative certification programs and graduate school in education. But the burden of student loans combined with relatively low teacher salaries often precludes the latter option. The current system encourages U of C students with a desire to teach to become investment bankers or consultants instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a growing consensus in American society that education at the K–12 level needs to be a top priority if American workers are to remain internationally competitive. America’s schools will continue to underperform if the best minds of our generation are turned away from the profession because of financial and practical constraints. As long as the University does not provide a way for students at the College to pursue certification as undergraduates, the University is part of the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The administration should commission a study to determine the best way to reinvent the School of Education and make it one of the top programs in the country. This would fit comfortably with the University’s traditional focus on research and theory as well as with the administration’s goal of giving back to the community. It’s the least a place that preaches the merits of the “Life of the Mind” can do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Maroon Editorial Board consists of the Editor-in-Chief, Managing Editor, Viewpoints Editors, and an additional Editorial Board member. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&amp;mdash;
