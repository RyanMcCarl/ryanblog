      It was after four then, and I lay in the dark, listening to the rain and to the morning trains coming through. They come from Buffalo and Chicago and the Far West, through Albany and down along the river in the early morning, and at one time or another I&rsquo;ve traveled on most of them, and I lay in the dark thinking about the polar air in the Pullman cars and the smell of nightclothes and the taste of dining-car water and the way it feels to end a day in Cleveland or Chicago and begin another in New York, particularly after you&rsquo;ve been away for a couple of years, and particularly in the summer.

      Let the most absent-minded of men be plunged in his deepest reveries - stand that man on his legs, set his feet a-going, and he will infallibly lead you to water, if water there be in all that region. &hellip;Yes, as every one knows, meditation and water are wedded for ever.&hellip;What of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get a broom and sweep down the decks?

Clare fed our leftover sandwiches to a stray mutt, who didn&rsquo;t chew the proper thirty-two times.

All of my jobs had kept me grounded in actual life whereas simply sitting in my room with my studies tended to make me unstable.

In New York City the endless blocks of huge buildings say to us, I&rsquo;m serious and within me serious people are doing serious things even though five thousand people in a building might only be playing with the market edge.

      -Must-read: the New York Times on a severe case of protracted bullying. This is real, and it&rsquo;s an enormous problem. There is a spectrum of school violence ranging from verbal harassment and bullying all the way to school shootings, and it needs to be taken more seriously and addressed more quickly at every stage. An atmosphere of security and mutual respect in classrooms is essential to students&rsquo; well-being and ability to learn.

      Happy Easter! &mdash;
The resurrection of Jesus is the sign to the world that God indeed does reign, does give life in death and that the love of God is stronger even than death (Rom. 8:36-39).
&hellip;
At the center of the church&rsquo;s teaching on peace and at the center of all Catholic social teaching, are the transcendence of God and the dignity of the human person. The human person is the clearest reflection of God&rsquo;s presence in the world; all of the church&rsquo;s work in pursuit of both justice and peace is designed to protect and promote the dignity of every person.

      Goethe comments that the Church erred in closing the canon of scripture, as God&rsquo;s creative work still continues, notably in the activity of great spirits like Mozart, Raphael, and Shakespeare, &ldquo;who can draw their lesser contemporaries higher.&rdquo;

For the first time in history, authors of highly successful works can hope to have them translated into twenty or thirty languages within a few years of publication, and foreign countries may even provide the primary readership for writers who have small audiences at home or who are censored by their governments.

      Had Pyrrhus not fallen by a beldham&rsquo;s hand in Argos or Julius Caesar not been knifed to death? They are not to be thought away. Time has branded them and fettered they are lodged in the room of the infinite possibilities they have ousted. But can those have been possible seeing that they never were? Or was that only possible which came to pass? Weave, weaver of the wind.

      From The Orient Express
One looks from the train
Almost as one looked as a child. In the sunlight
What I see still seems to me plain,
I am safe; but at evening
As the lands darken, a questioning
Precariousness comes over everything.
From Deutsch Durch Freud
Have you too sometimes, by the fire, at evening,
Wished that you were - whatever you once were?
From A Girl in a Library

      It was a beautiful fall day in Kenosha, Wisconsin, and I was reminded of why I love cross-country. The course at Wisconsin-Parkside is designed specifically for cross-country: it isn&rsquo;t a golf course with a white line drawn through it. It has handmade signs marking each quarter-mile, it has hills and trails through woods, and the start is sounded with a cannon rather than a gun. From the starting line, runners look forward and see an enormous hill surrounded by trees, and above the hill, the cloud-filled Wisconsin sky.
