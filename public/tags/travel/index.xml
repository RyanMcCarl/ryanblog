They come from Buffalo and Chicago and the Far West, through Albany and down along the river in the early morning, and at one time or another I&amp;rsquo;ve traveled on most of them, and I lay in the dark thinking about the polar air in the Pullman cars and the smell of nightclothes and the taste of dining-car water and the way it feels to end a day in Cleveland or Chicago and begin another in New York, particularly after you&amp;rsquo;ve been away for a couple of years, and particularly in the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;I took the eight-ten train into town in the morning and returned on the six-thirty.  I knew enough to avoid the empty house in the summer dusk, and I drove directly from the station parking lot to a good restaurant called Orpheo&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;&amp;ldquo;The Cure&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ldquo;The sun is in your hair.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ldquo;What?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ldquo;The sun is in your hair.  It&amp;rsquo;s a beautiful color.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;&amp;ldquo;The Chaste Clarissa&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name=&#39;more&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt that he was a captive of financial and sentimental commitments, like every other man I know, and that he was no more free to fall in love with a strange woman he saw on a street corner than he was to take a walking trip through French Guiana or to recommence his life in Chicago under an assumed name.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ldquo;Is divorce so dreadful and of all the things that hold a marriage together how many of them are good?&amp;rdquo; She sat down at the table.  &amp;ldquo;In Grenoble,&amp;rdquo; she said, &amp;ldquo;I wrote a long paper on Charles Stuart in French.  A professor at the University of Chicago wrote me a letter.  I couldn&amp;rsquo;t read a French newspaper without a dictionary today, I don&amp;rsquo;t have the time to follow any newspaper, and I am ashamed of my incompetence, ashamed of the way I look.  Oh, I guess I love you, I do love the children, but I love myself, I love my life, it has some value and some promise for me and Trencher&amp;rsquo;s roses make me feel that I&amp;rsquo;m losing this, that I&amp;rsquo;m losing my self-respect.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Walking down Lexington Avenue, we heard the drone bass of a church organ sound from the sky, and we and the others on the sidewalk looked up in piety and bewilderment, like a devout and stupid congregation, and saw a formation of heavy bombers heading for the sea.  As it got late, it got cold and clear and still, and on the stillness the waste from the smokestacks along the East River seemed to articulate, as legibly as the Pepsi-Cola plane, whole words and sentences.  Halcyon.  Disaster.  They were hard to make out.  It seemed the ebb of the year - an evil day for gastritis, sinus, and respiratory disease - and remembering other winters, the markings of the light convinced me that it was the season of divorce.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;I think that the seriousness of the day affected the children, and when they returned to the house, they were quiet.  The seriousness of it kept coming to me with the feeling that this change, like a phenomenon of speed, was affecting our watches as well as our hearts.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Now when I come home in the evenings, Ethel is still sitting on the stool by the sink cleaning vegetables.  I go with her into the children&amp;rsquo;s room.  The light there is bright.  The children have built something out an orange crate, something preposterous and ascendant, and their sweetness, their compulsion to build, the brightness of the light are reflected perfectly and increased in Ethel&amp;rsquo;s face.  Then she feeds them, bathes them, and sets the table, and stands for a moment in the middle of the room, trying to make some connection between the evening and the day.  Then it is over.  She lights the four candles, and we sit down to our supper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;&amp;ldquo;The Season of Divorce&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is true of even the best of us that if an observer can catch us boarding a train at a way station; if he will mark our faces, stripped by anxiety of their self-possession; if he will appraise our luggage, our clothing, and look out of the window to see who has driven us to the station; if he will listen to the harsh or tender things we say if we are with our families, or notice the way we put our suitcase onto the rack, check the position of our wallet, our key ring, and wipe the sweat off the back of our necks; if he can judge sensibly the self-importance, diffidence, or sadness with which we settle ourselves, he will be given a broader view of our lives than most of us would intend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;&amp;ldquo;The Summer Farmer&amp;rdquo;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&amp;mdash;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;From&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;The Man-Moth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He thinks the moon is a small hole at the top of the sky,&lt;br /&gt;proving the sky quite useless for protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;Elizabeth Bishop&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;From&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Mourning Poem for the Queen of Sunday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh who and oh who will sing Jesus down&lt;br /&gt;to help with struggling and doing without and being colored&lt;br /&gt;all through blue Monday?&lt;br /&gt;Till way next Sunday?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;Robert Hayden&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;From&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Questions of Travel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should we have stayed at home,&lt;br /&gt;wherever that may be?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;Elizabeth Bishop&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;From&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Maximus, to Himself&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is undone business&lt;br /&gt;I speak of, this morning,&lt;br /&gt;with the sea&lt;br /&gt;stretching out&lt;br /&gt;from my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;Charles Olson&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again: as the profound calm which only apparently precedes and prophesies of the storm, is perhaps more awful than the storm itself; for, indeed, the calm is but the wrapper and envelope of the storm; and contains it in itself, as the seemingly harmless rifle holds the fatal powder, and the ball, and the explosion; so the graceful repose of the line, as it silently serpentines about the oarsmen before being brought into actual play - this is a thing which carries more of true terror than any other aspect of this dangerous affair. But why say more? All men live enveloped in whale-lines. All are born with halters round their necks; but it is only when caught in the swift, sudden turn of death, that mortals realize the silent, subtle, ever-present perils of life. And if you be a philosopher, though seated in the whale-boat, you would not at heart feel one whit more of terror, than though seated before your evening fire with a poker, and not a harpoon, by your side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hermann Melville&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;em&gt;Moby-Dick&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Poems excerpted from &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Norton-Anthology-Modern-Contemporary-Poetry/dp/039332429X&#34;&gt;The Norton Anthology of Modern and Contemporary Poetry&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&amp;mdash;

 What does that indignity amount to, weighed, I mean, in the scales of the New Testament?  Do you think the archangel Gabriel thinks anything the less of me, because I promptly and respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance?  Who aint a slave?  Tell me that.  Well, then, however the old sea-captains may order me about - however they may thump and punch me about, I have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right; that everybody else is one way or other served in much the same way - either in a physical or metaphysical point of view, that is; and so the universal thump is passed around, and all hands should rub each other&amp;rsquo;s shoulder-blades, and be content.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt;As for me, I am tormented with an everlasting itch for things remote.  I love to sail forbidden seas, and land on barbarous coasts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt;Each silent worshipper seemed purposely sitting apart from the other, as if each silent grief were insular and incommunicable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt;But Faith, like a jackal, feeds among the tombs, and even from those dead doubts she gathers her most vital hope.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt;I began to be sensible of strange feelings.  I felt a melting in me.  No more my splintered heart and maddened hand were turned against the wolfish world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt;One most perilous and long voyage ended, only begins a second; and a second ended, only begins a third, and so on, for ever and for aye.  Such is the endlessness, yea, the intolerableness of all earthly effort.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt;&amp;lsquo;Now then, thou not only wantest to go a-whaling, to find out by experience what whaling is, buy ye also want to go in order to see the world?  Was not that what ye said?  I thought so.   Well then, just step forward there, and take a peep over the weather-bow, and then back to me and tell me what ye see there.&amp;rsquo;&amp;hellip;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt;Going forward and glancing over the weather bow, I perceived that the ship swinging to her anchor with the flood-tide, was now obliquely pointing towards the open ocean.  The prospect was unlimited, but exceedingly monotonous and forbidding; not the slightest variety that I could see.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt;&amp;lsquo;Well, what&amp;rsquo;s the report?&amp;rsquo; said Peleg when I came back; &amp;lsquo;what did ye see?&amp;rsquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt;&amp;lsquo;Not much,&amp;rsquo; I replied - &amp;lsquo;nothing but water; considerable horizon though, and there&amp;rsquo;s a squall coming up, I think.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt;&amp;lsquo;Well, what dost thou think then of seeing the world?  Do ye wish to go round Cape Horn to see any more of it, eh?  Can&amp;rsquo;t ye see the world where you stand?&amp;rsquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Herman Melville&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;  &amp;ndash;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34; style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;Moby-Dick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&amp;mdash;

      <title>Quotes from Harrison&#39;s &#39;Returning to Earth&#39;</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was good to finally know that the spirit was everywhere rather than a separate thing.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Clare fed our leftover sandwiches to a stray mutt, who didn&amp;rsquo;t chew the proper thirty-two times.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;All of my jobs had kept me grounded in actual life whereas simply sitting in my room with my studies tended to make me unstable.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;In New York City the endless blocks of huge buildings say to us, I&amp;rsquo;m serious and within me serious people are doing serious things even though five thousand people in a building might only be playing with the market edge.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a local euphemism in the U.P. that you&amp;rsquo;re not lost, you just can&amp;rsquo;t find your vehicle.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;A local politician rejecting foreign languages in a school budget had said, &amp;lsquo;If English was good enough for Jesus Christ it&amp;rsquo;s good enough for our kids.&amp;rsquo;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;I agreed with K on the addition of what is called a &amp;lsquo;space blanket&amp;rsquo; to the survival kits I put together and distribute for Mexicans intending to migrate north.  Space blankets are sheets of material used by campers to protect them from cold and dampness but I thought they could also defend against the summer heat of the ground, which reaches over one hundred and fifty degrees.  ..The packet was in a Velcro latched bag and could be attached to a waiste belt and weighed a little less than five pounds.  I distributed these free of charge to workers&amp;rsquo; groups and through left-leaning Catholic priests.  I was opposed by many on both sides of the border for political reasons, which didn&amp;rsquo;t bother me except for the legal expenses I incurred avoiding prosecution by the United States.  My raison d&amp;rsquo;etre was simple on the surface.  Estimates of crossing deaths along the entire nineteen-hundred-mile border with Mexico went as high as two thousand a year.  I had learned to be goofy rather than logically argumentative with my opponents.  I&amp;rsquo;d ask, If you could prevent twenty major airline disasters each year, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you?&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;By common consent we didn&amp;rsquo;t talk about anything more serious than the food and music, which in themselves have become more serious as I get older.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;He needed Montana but he also needed Chicago for her museums, libraries, theaters, bookstores, and most of all classical music, which he preferred to hear live.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;After a passing glance I averted my eyes from a photo of Carla and me at the cabin and then I fixed on it.  Was I ever that young?&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;There are no damaged goods when everyone is damaged goods.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about travel, though, is that it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to be consumed by the past against the backdrop of a fresh landscape.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lsquo;I was sorry to hear about Donald.  There was a man who could put in a day&amp;rsquo;s work.&amp;rsquo; I shook his hand as he offered this ultimate compliment of the north.  His hand felt like a semipetrified baseball mitt.  &amp;lsquo;You might not remember me.  Donny and me played football way back when, then worked together.  The name&amp;rsquo;s Teddy.&amp;rsquo;  He bowed, his face reddening, and walked away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lsquo;You were the left tackle,&amp;rsquo; I called out and he turned and grinned.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;On all levels the main reason to live is because you&amp;rsquo;re already alive.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;While we were out on the park bench a small bank of clouds came across the sun turning our mood somber.  He said, &amp;lsquo;After all, the fact of death is the most brutal thing we humans are forced to accept,&amp;rsquo; but then the sun came out again and I told him that the day after the burial Herald had said, &amp;lsquo;Mother, it can&amp;rsquo;t be awful if it happens to every living thing.&amp;rsquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jim Harrison&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;ndash;&lt;em&gt;Returning to Earth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy Jim Harrison&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;True North&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Returning-to-Earth/Jim-Harrison/e/9780802143310/?itm=3&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Returning to Earth&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://search.barnesandnoble.com/True-North/Jim-Harrison/e/9780802142061/?itm=1&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&amp;mdash;

      <title>Readings from Mann, Golley, and Eliot</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;-Must-read: the &lt;span style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;New York Times&lt;/span&gt; on a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/24/us/24land.html?hp&#34;&gt;severe case of protracted bullying&lt;/a&gt;.  This is real, and it&amp;rsquo;s an enormous problem.  There is a spectrum of school violence ranging from verbal harassment and bullying all the way to school shootings, and it needs to be taken more seriously and addressed more quickly at every stage.  An atmosphere of security and mutual respect in classrooms is essential to students&amp;rsquo; well-being and ability to learn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A human being lives out not only his personal life as an individual, but also, consciously or subconsciously, the lives of his epoch and contemporaries.  &amp;hellip;All sorts of personal goals, purposes, hopes, prospects may float before the eyes of a given individual, from which he may then glean the impulse for exerting himself for great deeds; if the impersonal world around him, however, if the times themselves, despite all their hustle and bustle, provide him with neither hopes nor prospects, if they secretly supply him with evidence that things are in fact hopeless, without prospect or remedy, if the times respond with hollow silence to every conscious or subconscious question, however it may be posed, about the ultimate, unequivocal meaning of all exertions and deeds that are more than exclusively personal - then it is almost inevitable&amp;hellip;that the situation will have a crippling effect, which, following moral and spiritual paths, may even spread to that person&amp;rsquo;s physical and organic life.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Two days of travel separate this young man (and young he is, with few firm roots in life) from his everyday world, especially from what might be called his duties, interests, worries, and prospects - separate him far more than he had dreamed possible as he rode to the station in a hansom cab.  Space, as it rolls and tumbles away between him and his native soil, proves to have powers normally ascribed only to time; from hour to hour, space brings about changes very like those time produces, yet surpassing them in certain ways.  Space, like time, gives birth to forgetfulness, but does so by removing an individual from all relationships and placing him in a free and pristine state - indeed, in but a moment it can turn a pedant and a philistine into something like a vagabond.  Time, they say, is water from the river Lethe, but alien air is a similar drink; and if its effects are less profound, it works all the more quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thomas Mann&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;The Magic Mountain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ldquo;All divine attributes have been taken over by human hands,&amp;rdquo; (Hirato Renkichi) wrote.  &amp;ldquo;Today, the engine of God is the engine of the city, and partakes in the activities of humanity&amp;rsquo;s millions.&amp;rdquo;  Almost every sentence of this document seems to anticipate Paul Virilio&amp;rsquo;s 1997 equation of &amp;ldquo;new technologies&amp;rdquo; with the &amp;ldquo;three traditional characteristics of the Divine: ubiquity, instantaneity, and immediacy.&amp;rdquo;  Although Virilio refers here to a much later technological revolution, the logic of his thinking echoes the poetics of Hirato Renkichi.  &amp;hellip;For Hirato, the powers of the divine had come to reside in &amp;ldquo;the impulsive candor of the machine, in its light, its heat, its ceaseless rhythms.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gregory Golley&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;When Our Eyes No Longer See: Realism, Science, and Ecology in Japanese Literary Modernism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a poet&amp;rsquo;s mind is perfectly equipped for its work, it is constantly amalgamating disparate experience; the ordinary man&amp;rsquo;s experience is chaotic, irregular, fragmentary.  The latter falls in love, or reads Spinoza, and these two experiences have nothing to do with each other, or with the noise of the typewriter or the smell of cooking; in the mind of the poet these experiences are always forming new wholes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;T.S. Eliot&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;&amp;ldquo;The Metaphysical Poets,&amp;rdquo; quoted in Golley, &lt;span style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;When Our Eyes No Longer See&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&amp;mdash;

      <title>Readings on Easter, Just War Theory, and Japanese lit</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Happy Easter! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The resurrection of Jesus is the sign to the world that God indeed does reign, does give life in death and that the love of God is stronger even than death (Rom. 8:36-39).&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;At the center of the church&amp;rsquo;s teaching on peace and at the center of all Catholic social teaching, are the transcendence of God and the dignity of the human person.  The human person is the clearest reflection of God&amp;rsquo;s presence in the world; all of the church&amp;rsquo;s work in pursuit of both justice and peace is designed to protect and promote the dignity of every person.  For each person not only reflects God, but is the expression of God&amp;rsquo;s creative work and the meaning of Christ&amp;rsquo;s redemptive ministry.  Christians approach the problem of war and peace with fear and reverence.  God is the Lord of life, and so each human life is sacred; modern warfare threatens the obliteration of human life on a previously unimaginable scale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;U.S. Catholic Bishops&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;ndash;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;The Challenge of Peace: God&amp;rsquo;s Promise and Our Response (The Pastoral Letter on War and Peace, 1983)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.  &lt;span id=&#34;en-NIV-28140&#34; class=&#34;sup&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, &lt;span id=&#34;en-NIV-28141&#34; class=&#34;sup&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Romans 8:37-39&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The aggressor is always peace-loving; he would prefer to take over our country unopposed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Carl Von Clausewitz, quoted in J.T. Turner, &amp;ldquo;Threats, Values and Defense: Does the Defense of Values by Force Remain a Moral Possibility?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His desire for a woman was not of a sort to make him want this particular woman - it was something to be taken care of lightly and with no sense of guilt.  This woman was too clean.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;The window of the waiting-room was clear for an instant as the train started to move.  Komako&amp;rsquo;s face glowed forth, and as quickly disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;But this love would leave behind it nothing so definite as a piece of Chijimi.  Though cloth to be worn is among the most short-lived of craftworks, a good piece of Chijimi, if it has been taken care of, can be worn quite unfaded a half-century and more after weaving.  As Shimamura thought absently how human intricacies have not even so long a life, the image of Komako as the mother of another man&amp;rsquo;s children suddenly floated into his mind.  He looked around, startled.  Possibly he was tired.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;He leaned against the brazier, provided against the coming of the snowy season, and thought how unlikely it was that he would come again once he had left.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Komako had come up to him, he did not know when.  She took his hand.  He looked around at her but said nothing.  She gazed at the fire, the pulse of the fire beating on her intent, slightly flushed face.  Shimamura felt a violent rising in his chest.  Komako&amp;rsquo;s hair was coming undone, and her throat was bare and arched.  His fingers trembled from the urge to touch it.  His hand was warm, but Komako&amp;rsquo;s was still warmer.  He did not know why he should feel that a separation was forcing itself upon them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kawabata Yasunari&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;ndash;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;Snow Country&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously he did not much enjoy reading and discussing a typical month&amp;rsquo;s production of Japanese literature.  In a 1935 essay Kobayashi expressed his annoyance with authors who complained that he had not been sufficiently kind in his reviews, and asked sardonically what kindness contemporary authors have ever shown their critics.  The only kindness a critic really wants from authors is that they will supply him with the basis for writing decent criticism; but present-day authors do precisely the opposite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Donald Keene&lt;br /&gt; &amp;ndash;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;Dawn to the West: A History of Japanese Literature (Vol. 4)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&amp;mdash;

      <title>Quotes from David Damrosch, Kahlil Gibran, &amp; Paul Tillich</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Goethe comments that the Church erred in closing the canon of scripture, as God&amp;rsquo;s creative work still continues, notably in the activity of great spirits like Mozart, Raphael, and Shakespeare, &amp;ldquo;who can draw their lesser contemporaries higher.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;For the first time in history, authors of highly successful works can hope to have them translated into twenty or thirty languages within a few years of publication, and foreign countries may even provide the primary readership for writers who have small audiences at home or who are censored by their governments.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;All&lt;/em&gt; works cease to be the exclusive products of their original culture once they are translated; all become works that only &amp;ldquo;began&amp;rdquo; in their original language.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Society melts away in the vast echo chamber of (literary critic Harold) &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Bloom&#34;&gt;Bloom&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s mind, replaced by the warring voices of the few great titans of the literary universe.  The fewer the better: &amp;hellip;Bloom continually narrows his authors&amp;rsquo; already narrow circle.  &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1573225142&#34;&gt;The Western Canon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; treats twenty-six writers, but what need twenty-six?  &amp;ldquo;Most simply, the Canon is Plato and Shakespeare&amp;rdquo; (34).  What need even two?  &amp;ldquo;At once no one and everyone, nothing and everything, Shakespeare is the Western Canon&amp;rdquo; (71).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet even Bloom finally relents.  Having spent almost five hundred pages extolling the greatness of the few greatest writers at the heart of his version of the Western canon, he closes with an appendix listing several &lt;em&gt;thousand&lt;/em&gt; works by more than eight hundred and fifty writers whom he considers to be the key figures in the Western canon as a whole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David Damrosch&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/What-World-Literature-Translation-Transnation/dp/0691049866/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1204791136&amp;amp;sr=1-1&#34;&gt;What is World Literature&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How shall I go in peace and without sorrow? Nay, not without a wound in the spirit shall I leave this city.  Long were the days of pain I have spent within its walls, and long were the nights of aloneness; and who can depart from his pain and his aloneness without regret?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too many fragments of the spirit have I scattered in these streets, and too many are the children of my longing that walk naked among these hills, and I cannot withdraw from them without a burden and an ache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not a garment I cast off this day, but a skin that I tear with my own hands.  Nor is it a thought I leave behind me, but a heart made sweet with hunger and with thirst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet I cannot tarry longer.  The sea that calls all things unto her calls me, and I must embark.&lt;br /&gt;For to stay, though the hours burn in the night, is to freeze and crystallize and be bound in a mould. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fain would I take with me all that is here. But how shall I?  A voice cannot carry the tongue and the lips that give it wings. Alone must it seek the ether.  And alone and without his nest shall the eagle fly across the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kahlil Gibran&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;em&gt;The Prophet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sociological analyses of the present period have pointed to the importance of anxiety as a group phenomenon.  Literature and art have made anxiety a main theme of their creations, in content as well as in style.  The effect of this has been the awakening of at least the educated groups to an awareness of their own anxiety, and a permeation of the public consciousness by ideas and symbols of anxiety.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;The first assertion about the nature of anxiety is this: anxiety is the state in which a being is aware of its possible nonbeing.  &amp;hellip;It is not the realization of universal transitoriness, not even the experience of the death of others, but the impression of these events on the always latent awareness of our own having to die that produces anxiety.  Anxiety is finitude, experienced as one&amp;rsquo;s own finitude.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul Tillich&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;em&gt;The Courage to Be&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&amp;mdash;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Had Pyrrhus not fallen by a beldham&amp;rsquo;s hand in Argos or Julius Caesar not been knifed to death? They are not to be thought away. Time has branded them and fettered they are lodged in the room of the infinite possibilities they have ousted. But can those have been possible seeing that they never were? Or was that only possible which came to pass? Weave, weaver of the wind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-History, Stephen said, is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake.&lt;br /&gt;From the playfield the boys raised a shout. A whirring whistle: goal. What if that nightmare gave you a back kick?&lt;br /&gt;-The ways of the Creator are not our ways, Mr Deasy said. All history moves towards one great goal, the manifestation of God.&lt;br /&gt;Stephen jerked his thumb towards the window, saying:&lt;br /&gt;-That is God.&lt;br /&gt;Hooray! Ay! Whirrwhee!&lt;br /&gt;-What? Mr Deasy asked.&lt;br /&gt;-A shout in the street, Stephen answered, shrugging his shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For that are you pining, the bark of their applause?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Across the sands of all the world, followed by the sun&amp;rsquo;s flaming sword, to the west, trekking to evening lands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our souls, shame-wounded by our sins, cling to us yet more, a woman to her lover clinging, the more the more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somewhere in the east: early morning: set off at dawn, travel round in front of the sun, steal a day&amp;rsquo;s march on him. Keep it up for ever never grow a day old technically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Thank you, sir. Another time.&lt;br /&gt;A speck of eager fire from foxeyes thanked him. He withdrew his gaze after an instant. No: better not: another time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To smell the gentle smoke of tea, fume of the pan, sizzling butter. Be near her ample bedwarmed flesh. Yes, yes.&lt;br /&gt;Quick warm sunlight came running from Berkeley Road, swiftly, in slim sandals, along the brightening footpath. Runs, she runs to meet me, a girl with gold hair on the wind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;James Joyce&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&amp;mdash;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;From &lt;/em&gt;The Orient Express&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One looks from the train&lt;br /&gt;Almost as one looked as a child.  In the sunlight&lt;br /&gt;What I see still seems to me plain,&lt;br /&gt;I am safe; but at evening&lt;br /&gt;As the lands darken, a questioning&lt;br /&gt;Precariousness comes over everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;From &lt;/em&gt;Deutsch Durch Freud&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have you too sometimes, by the fire, at evening,&lt;br /&gt;Wished that you were - whatever you once were?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;From &lt;/em&gt;A Girl in a Library&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An object among dreams, you sit here with your shoes off&lt;br /&gt;And curl your legs up under you; your eyes&lt;br /&gt;Close for a moment, your face moves toward sleep&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;You are very human.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;One sees it, in the glass, in one&amp;rsquo;s own eyes.&lt;br /&gt;In rooms alone, in galleries, in libraries,&lt;br /&gt;In tears, in searchings of the heart, in staggering joys&lt;br /&gt;We memorize once more our old creation,&lt;br /&gt;Humanity: with what yawns the unwilling&lt;br /&gt;Flesh puts on its spirit, O my sister!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;From &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wake, but before I know it it is done,&lt;br /&gt;The day, I sleep.  And of days like these the years,&lt;br /&gt;A life is made.  I nod, consenting to my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Meteorite&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Star, that looked so long among the stones&lt;br /&gt;And picked from them, half iron and half dirt,&lt;br /&gt;One; and bent and put it to her lips&lt;br /&gt;And breathed upon it till at last it burned&lt;br /&gt;Uncertainly, among the stars its sisters -&lt;br /&gt;Breathe on me still, star, sister.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&amp;mdash;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;From&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Transit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A woman I have never seen before&lt;br /&gt;Steps from the darkness of her town-house door&lt;br /&gt;At just that crux of time when she is made&lt;br /&gt;So beautiful that she or time must fade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Richard Wilbur&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;From&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Journey of the Year 1694&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I trudged alone far into Yoshino. The mountains truly stretch on and on, and white clouds lie piled on the peaks. A smoky rain buried the valleys, here and there interrupted by the huts of the mountain folk, very small. To the west, the sound of a tree being felled; to the east, the echo. The voices of the bells of many temples found a response deep in my heart.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Weary of sleeping every night in strange lodgings, I got up from bed while it was still dark and went out onto the beach.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;As the days went by in travel, untying my straw sandals at this place and laying down my walking stick at that, the year drew to a close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Basho (tr.

It&amp;rsquo;s a 12-hour flight and a 13-hour difference from eastern time, so I&amp;rsquo;ll arrive in Tokyo around 4 pm on Thursday.  Then, I&amp;rsquo;ll figure out how to ride the bus from Narita to Shinjuku, the district in the photo, and at Shinjuku I&amp;rsquo;ll meet up with my friend Ai.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I became friends with Ai when she was an exchange student in my hometown of Muskegon, MI, during my senior year of high school; although I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen her in over three years, we&amp;rsquo;ve kept in touch through letters and emails.  I&amp;rsquo;ll be staying with Ai and making the most of Tokyo for two weeks, seeing as much as I can and improving my Japanese as much as possible in the process. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Sunday, I&amp;rsquo;ll also spend the day with the Takada family, the wonderful host parents and sisters I stayed with for six weeks as an exchange student near Tokyo in the summer before my senior year of high school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Naturally, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to spend any of this precious time typing in English and surfing the Internet.  So the blog is on hiatus until September 20th or so.  Thank you, as always, for reading, and feel free to browse the archives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, I will take hundreds of photos and keep a detailed travel journal these next two weeks, and I will post some of that on this blog when I return.  Until then:  &lt;em&gt;Ja, ne.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&amp;mdash;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;He read no books, but his thoughts were often with God; it was natural, coming of simplicity and awe. The stars in the sky, the wind in the trees, the solitude and the wide-spreading snow, the might of earth and over earth filled him many times a day with a deep earnestness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knut Hamsun&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;em&gt;Growth of the Soil&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;From &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dante&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He did not return, even after his death, to&lt;br /&gt;That ancient city he was rooted in.&lt;br /&gt;Going away, he did not pause for breath&lt;br /&gt;Nor look back. My song is for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anna Akhmatova&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;From &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Heaven and Earth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so I cross into another world&lt;br /&gt;shyly and in homage linger for an invitation&lt;br /&gt;from this unknown that I would trespass on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very glad, and all alone in the world,&lt;br /&gt;all alone, and very glad, in a new world&lt;br /&gt;where I am disembarked at last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For when it is quite, quite nothing, then it is everything.&lt;br /&gt;When I am trodden quite out, quite, quite out,&lt;br /&gt;every vestige gone, then I am here&lt;br /&gt;risen, and setting my foot on another world&lt;br /&gt;risen, not born again, but risen, body the same as before,&lt;br /&gt;new beyond knowledge of newness, alive beyond life,&lt;br /&gt;proud beyond inkling or furthest conception of pride,&lt;br /&gt;living where life was never yet dreamed of, nor hinted at,&lt;br /&gt;here, in the other world, still terrestrial&lt;br /&gt;myself, the same as before, yet unaccountably new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ah no, I cannot tell you what it is, the new world.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot tell you the mad, astounded rapture of its discovery.&lt;br /&gt;I shall be mad with delight before I have done,&lt;br /&gt;and whosoever comes after will find me in the new world&lt;br /&gt;a madman in rapture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;D.H. Lawrence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And in the night, he lay wanting her, and she was willing. She did not go away next morning; all that day she did not go, but helped about the place; milked the goats, and scoured pots and things with fine sand, and got them clean. She did not go away at all. Inger was her name. And Isak was his name. &amp;hellip; She did not run away. When he had been out, and came home again, there was Inger at the hut; the two were one, the woman and the hut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ho, they were getting well-to-do, with this hut of theirs, this farm of theirs; why, &amp;lsquo;twas good enough for anyone. Aye, they&amp;rsquo;d as good as all they could wish for already. Oh, that Inger; he loved her and she loved him again; they were frugal folk; they lived in primitive wise, and lacked for nothing. &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s go to sleep!&amp;rdquo; And they went to sleep. And wakened in the morning to another day, with things to look at, matters to see to, once again; aye, toil and pleasure, ups and downs, the way of life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knut Hamsun&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;em&gt;Growth of the Soil&lt;/em&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&amp;mdash;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Short History&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Corn planted us; tamed cattle made us tame.&lt;br /&gt;Thence hut and citadel and kingdom came.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ndash;Richard Wilbur&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let us not fool ourselves. What we knew is dead, and maybe the greatest part of what we were is dead. What&amp;rsquo;s out there is perhaps good, but it&amp;rsquo;s nothing we know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;John Steinbeck, &lt;em&gt;Travels with Charley&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The place of my origin had changed, and having gone away I had not changed with it. In my memory it stood as it once did and its outward appearance confused and angered me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;John Steinbeck, &lt;em&gt;Travels with Charley&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;From &lt;/em&gt;For C.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the clash of elevator gates&lt;br /&gt;And the long sinking, she emerges where,&lt;br /&gt;A slight thing in the morning&amp;rsquo;s crosstown glare,&lt;br /&gt;She looks up toward the window where he waits,&lt;br /&gt;Then in a fleeting taxi joins the rest&lt;br /&gt;Of the huge traffic bound forever west.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ndash;Richard Wilbur&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, financial analysts in pin-striped suits do not like being compared with bare-assed apes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;Burton Malkiel, &lt;em&gt;A Random Walk Down Wall Street&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a stranger addresses Charley in baby talk, Charley avoids him. For Charley is not a human; he&amp;rsquo;s a dog, and he likes it that way. He feels that he is a first-rate dog and has no wish to be a second-rate human.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;John Steinbeck, &lt;em&gt;Travels with Charley&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The public, it seemed, would buy anything. &amp;hellip;The prize&amp;hellip;must surely goe to the unknown soul who started &amp;ldquo;A Company for carrying on an undertaking of great advantage, but nobody to know what it is.&amp;rdquo; The prospectus promised unheard-of rewards. At nine o&amp;rsquo;clock in the morning, when the subscription books opened, crowds of people from all walks of life practically beat down the door in an effort to subscribe. Within five hours 1,000 investors handed over their money for shares in the company. Not being greedy himself, the promoter promptly closed up shop and set off for the Continent. He was never heard from again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;Burton Malkiel, &lt;em&gt;A Random Walk Down Wall Street&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Current events: a hilarious, brilliantly written &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/01/business/media/01carr.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;amp;oref=slogin&#34;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; on Rupert Murdoch&amp;rsquo;s sadly successful takeover of the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; and its parent, the Dow Jones Company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&amp;mdash;

      <title>Quotes from Thomas Merton and John Steinbeck</title>
      <link>http://ryanmccarl.com/post/quotes-from-thomas-merton-and-john-steinbeck/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Living is more than submission: it is creation.  To live is to create one&amp;rsquo;s own world as a scene of personal happiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Thomas Merton, &amp;ldquo;The Street is For Celebration&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Celebration is the beginning of confidence, therefore of power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Thomas Merton, &amp;ldquo;The Street is For Celebration&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next passage in my journey is a love affair.  I am in love with Montana.  For other states I have admiration, respect, recognition, even some affection, but with Montana it is love, and it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to analyze love when you&amp;rsquo;re in it.  &amp;hellip; It seems to me that Montana is a great splash of grandeur.  The scale is huge but not overpowering.  The land is rich with grass and color, and the mountains are the kind I would create if mountains were ever put on my agenda.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;The calm of the mountains and the rolling grasslands had got into the inhabitants.  It was hunting season when I drove through the state.  The men I talked to seemed to me not moved to a riot of seasonal slaughter but simply to be going out to kill edible meat.  Again my attitude may be informed by love, but it seemed to me that the towns were places to live in rather than nervous hives.  People had time to pause in their occupations to undertake the passing art of neighborliness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-John Steinbeck, &lt;em&gt;Travels with Charley&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When we live superficially, when we are always outside ourselves, never quite &amp;ldquo;with&amp;rdquo; ourselves, always divided and pulled in many directions by conflicting plans and projects, we find ourselves doing many things that we do not really want to do, saying things we do not really mean, needing things we do not really need, exhausting ourselves for what we secretly realize to be worthless and without meaning in our lives: &amp;ldquo;Why spend your money on what is not food and your earnings on what never satisfies?&amp;rdquo; (Isaiah 55:2)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Thomas Merton, &amp;ldquo;Creative Silence&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having a companion fixes you in time and that the present, but when the quality of aloneness settles down, past, present, and future all flow together.  A memory, a present event, and a forecast all equally present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-John Steinbeck, &lt;em&gt;Travels with Charley&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the long run, the discipline of creative silence demands a certain kind of faith.  For when we come face to face with ourselves in the lonely ground of our own being, we confront many questions about the value of our existence, the reality of our commitments, the authenticity of our everyday lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Thomas Merton, &amp;ldquo;Creative Silence&amp;rdquo;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&amp;mdash;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A dog, particularly an exotic like Charley, is a bond between strangers.  Many conversations en route began with &amp;ldquo;What degree of a dog is that?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dairy man had a Ph.D. in mathematics, and he must have had some training in philosophy.  He liked what he was doing and he didn&amp;rsquo;t want to be somewhere else - one of the very few contented people I met in my whole journey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then a submarine slipped to the surface half a mile away, and the day lost part of its brightness.  Farther away another dark creature slashed through the water, and another; of course they are based in New London, and this is their home.  And perhaps they are keeping the world&amp;rsquo;s peace with their venom.  I wish I could like submarines, for then I might find them beautiful, but they are designed for destruction, and while they may explore and chart the sea bottom, and draw new trade lines under the Arctic ice, their main purpose is threat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who doesn&amp;rsquo;t like to be a center for concern?  A kind of second childhood falls on so many men.  They trade their violence for the promise of a small increase of life span.  In effect, the head of the house becomes the youngest child.  And I have searched myself for this possibility with a kind of horror.  For I have always lived violently, drunk hugely, eaten too much or not at all, slept around the clock or missed two nights of sleeping, worked too hard and too long in glory, or slobbed for a time in utter laziness.  I&amp;rsquo;ve lifted, pulled, chopped, climbed, made love with joy and taken my hangovers as a consequence, not as a punishment.  I did not want to surrender fierceness for a small gain in yardage.  My wife married a man; I saw no reason why she should inherit a baby. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw in their eyes something I was to see over and over in every part of the nation - a burning desire to go, to move, to get under way, anyplace, away from any Here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The word &amp;ldquo;Ftt&amp;rdquo; usually means he would like to salute a bush or a tree.  I opened the cab door and let him out, and he went about his ceremony.  He doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to think about it to do it well.  It is my experience that in some areas Charley is more intelligent than I am, but in others he is abysmally ignorant.  He can&amp;rsquo;t read, can&amp;rsquo;t drive a car, and has no grasp of mathematics.  But in his own field of endeavor, which was now practicing, the slow, imperial smelling over and anointing of an area, he has no peer.  Of course his horizons are limited, but how wide are mine?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-John Steinbeck, &lt;em&gt;Travels with Charley in Search of America &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Personal note: Steinbeck is my favorite American writer, and &lt;em&gt;Travels with Charley &lt;/em&gt;is on track to become one of my absolute favorite books; I&amp;rsquo;m especially excited about it because my family just got a second dog, a black retriever named Maggie.  I&amp;rsquo;ll get to meet Maggie for the first time when I go home to Muskegon on Friday for a Counting Crows concert.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&amp;mdash;
