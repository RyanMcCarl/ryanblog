      <description>&lt;p&gt;The following is political philosopher &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iep.utm.edu/nozick/&#34;&gt;Robert Nozick&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s incredible allegory of the &amp;ldquo;Experience Machine,&amp;rdquo; from his book &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Anarchy-State-Utopia-Robert-Nozick/dp/0465097200/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1304101535&amp;amp;sr=8-1&#34;&gt;Anarchy, State, and Utopia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.  The allegory makes a case against hedonism, the idea that sensory pleasure is the highest good:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;br /&gt;Suppose there were an experience machine that would give you any experience you desired. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name=&#39;more&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Superduper neuropsychologists could stimulate your brain so that you would think and feel you were writing a great novel, or making a friend, or reading an interesting book. All the time you would be floating in a tank, with electrodes attached to your brain. Should you plug into this machine for life, preprogramming your life’s experiences? If you are worried about missing out on desirable experiences, we can suppose that business enterprises have researched thoroughly the lives of many others. You can pick and choose from their large library or smorgasbord of such experiences, selecting your life’s experiences for, say, the next two years. After two years have passed, you will have ten minutes or ten hours out of the tank, to select the experiences of your &lt;i&gt;next&lt;/i&gt; two years. Of course, while in the tank you won’t know that you’re there; you’ll think it’s all actually happening. Others can also plug in to have the experiences they want, so there’s no need to stay unplugged to serve them. (Ignore problems such as who will service the machines if everyone plugs in.) Would you plug in? &lt;i&gt;What else can matter to us, other than how our lives feel from the inside?&lt;/i&gt; Nor should you refrain because of the few moments of distress between the moment you’ve decided and the moment you’re plugged. What’s a few moments of distress compared to a lifetime of bliss (if that’s what you choose), and why feel any distress at all if your decision &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; the best one?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What does matter to us in addition to our experiences? First, we want to &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; certain things, and not just have the experience of doing them. In the case of certain experiences, it is only because first we want to do the actions that we want the experiences of doing them or thinking we’ve done them. (But &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; do we want to do the activities rather than merely to experience them?) A second reason for not plugging in is that we want to &lt;i&gt;be&lt;/i&gt; a certain way, to be a certain sort of person. Someone floating in a tank is an indeterminate blob. There is no answer to the question of what a person is like who has long been in the tank. Is he couragous, kind, intelligent, witty, loving? It’s not merely that it’s difficult to tell; there’s no way he is. Plugging into the machine is a kind of suicide. It will seem to some, trapped by a picture, that nothing about what we are like can matter except as it gets reflected in our experiences. But why should we be concerned only with how our time is filled, but not with what we are?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thirdly, plugging into an experience machine limits us to a man-made reality, to a world no deeper or more important than that which people can construct. There is no actual contact with any deeper reality, though the experience of it can be simulated. Many persons desire to leave themselves open to such contact and to a plumbing of deeper significance. This clarifies the intensity of the conflict over psychoactive drugs, which some view as mere local experience machines, and others view as avenues to a deeper reality; what some view as equivalent to surrender to the experience machine, others view as following one of the reasons &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; to surrender!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We learn that something matters to us in addition to experience by imagining an experience machine and then realizing that we would not use it. We can continue to imagine a sequence of machines each designed to fill lacks suggested for the earlier machines. For example, since the experience machine doesn’t meet our desire to be a certain way, imagine a transformation machine which transforms us into whatever sort of person we’d like to be (compatible with our staying us). Surely one would not use the transformation machine to become as one would wish, and thereupon plug into the experience machine! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So something matters in addition to one’s experiences and what one is like. Nor is the reason merely that one’s experiences are unconnected with what one is like. For the experience machine might be limited to provide only experiences possible to the sort of person plugged in. Is it that we want to make a difference in the world? Consider then the result machine, which produces in the world any result you would produce and injects your vector input into any joint activity. I won’t pursue here the fascinating details of these or other machines. What is most disturbing about them is their living of our lives for us. Is it misguided to search for particular additional functions beyond the competence of machines to do for us? Perhaps what we desire is to live (an active verb) ourselves, in contact with reality. (And this, machines cannot do for us.) Without elaborating on the implications of this, which I believe connect surprisingly with issues about free will and causal accounts of knowledge, it’s merely worth noting the intricacy of the question of what matters for people other than their experiences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robert Nozick&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Anarchy-State-Utopia-Robert-Nozick/dp/0465097200/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1304101535&amp;amp;sr=8-1&#34;&gt;Anarchy, State, and Utopia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&amp;mdash;
