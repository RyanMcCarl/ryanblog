      Happy Easter! &mdash;
The resurrection of Jesus is the sign to the world that God indeed does reign, does give life in death and that the love of God is stronger even than death (Rom. 8:36-39).
&hellip;
At the center of the church&rsquo;s teaching on peace and at the center of all Catholic social teaching, are the transcendence of God and the dignity of the human person. The human person is the clearest reflection of God&rsquo;s presence in the world; all of the church&rsquo;s work in pursuit of both justice and peace is designed to protect and promote the dignity of every person.

      Even in mundane situations, the individual must act in order to discover what he is and he must act in order to continue experiencing aspects of himself which he values and enjoys. If he thinks of himself as a businessman, a parent, an athlete, an intellectual, he must engage in behavior appropriate to this self-image. If he does not, he must redefine himself, or he will be left feeling anxious and needful.

      He who refuses to embrace a unique opportunity loses the prize as surely as if he tried and failed.
&hellip;
Our errors are surely not such awfully solemn things. In a world where we are so certain to incur them in spite of all our caution, a certain lightness of heart seems healthier than this excessive nervousness on their behalf.
&hellip;
Let us give the name hypothesis to anything that may be proposed to our belief; and just as the electricians speak of live and dead wires, let us speak of any hypothesis as either live or dead.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      The following editorial was published in this morning&rsquo;s Philadelphia Inquirer:
I was thrilled to learn that The Golden Compass, the first book in Philip Pullman&rsquo;s &ldquo;His Dark Materials&rdquo; trilogy, was going to be released as a movie on Friday. I read the trilogy first in middle school and again in high school, and it was my favorite story for a long time. It is filled with imagination and erudition, and it is a significant cut above the vast majority of works aimed at young adults.

      And, certainly, the way to maturity in thinking is a difficult path. Much must be left behind: early dreams, poetic imaginations, cherished legends, favored doctrines, accustomed laws and ritual traditions. Some of them must be restored on a deeper level, some must be given up. Despite this price, maturity can be gained - a manly, self-critical, convincing faith, not produced by reasoning, but reasonable, and at the same time rooted in the message of the divine foolishness, the ultimate source of wisdom.

      Every summer he&rsquo;s on the prarie harvesting wheat and every winter in the Wisconsin forests chopping cordwood. That&rsquo;s his life.
A life maybe as good as any other.
&ndash;Knut Hamsun, &ldquo;On the Prarie&rdquo; (from Tales of Love and Loss)
The theological dimension is needed both for interpreting and for solving present day problems in human society.
&ndash;Pope John Paul II, Centesimus Annus
The human being is made for love and cannot live without love.

      As we would expect, during most wars consumer spending is deliberately held back by heavy taxes to make room for swelling military expenditure. During World War II, for example, consumption was squeezed back by heavy taxes to barely more than half of GDP. â€¦During the Vietnam War military expenses for that conflict were not compensated by taxes to roll back consumption and the excess demand for goods and services ignited a subsequent inflation.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      Not many years ago great offence was given by an eminent writer who remarked that the time had come when the history of Christianity should be treated in a truly historical spirit, in the same spirit in which we treat the history of other religions, such as Brahmanism, Buddhism, or Mohammedanism. And yet what can be truer? He must be a man of little faith, who would fear to subject his own religion to the same critical tests to which the historian subjects all other religions.

      Never does one do evil so fully and so gaily as when one does it as a matter of conscience.
&ndash;Pensee 895
What a man&rsquo;s virtue is capable of is not to be measured by his exceptional efforts, but by his daily life.
&ndash;Pensee 352
He must have movements of humiliation, not as a consequence of his nature, but of penitence; not as a constant attitude, but to permit him to rise to elevation.

      For whom, he thought, that splendor? For me alone?
Yet it will be here long after I perish.
-Czeslaw Milosz, from &ldquo;Study of Loneliness&rdquo;
Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for thereby some have entertained angels unawares. Remember those who are in prison, as though in prison with them; and those who are ill-treated, since you are also in the body.
-Hebrews 13:1-3
The behavior of individual consumers and producers in the rational pursuit of their objectives is governed by the principle of marginal utility, or marginality.
