      <title>Transitions: A personal update</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;No more than three weeks after making my final decision to move to Ann Arbor to pursue an M.A. in Education at the University of Michigan and become a high school history teacher, it is happening: my furniture is being sold or moved, my possessions are being sorted into boxes.  Yesterday was my last day at the bookstore I&amp;rsquo;ve worked at as a manager since August.  On Friday I&amp;rsquo;ll be on the road to Muskegon with a stuffed car and another empty apartment behind me, and on Sunday I&amp;rsquo;ll be in Ann Arbor to begin the next stage of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel alive with the movement of it all: &amp;ldquo;A man gets up, a few strokes of a brush and then already it&amp;rsquo;s evening.&amp;rdquo; (Milosz)&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&amp;mdash;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;An article I wrote about my incredible high school cross country coach, John Swinburne, was published today in the &lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34; style=&#34;font-style: italic; &#34;&gt;Muskegon Chronicle&lt;/span&gt; and on MLive.com.  Check it out &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mlive.com/sports/muskegon/index.ssf/2009/04/popular_coach_athletic_directo.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Swinburne has worked formally and informally in education as a coach, teacher, athletic director, driver&amp;rsquo;s ed instructor, youth group leader, and mentor to thousands of students in the Muskegon, MI area for four decades.  He is a truly great man who has changed many lives, including mine, through his coaching.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&amp;mdash;

      <title>A personal update, and last quotes from Growth of the Soil</title>
      <link>http://ryanmccarl.com/post/a-personal-update-and-last-quotes-from-growth-of-the-soil/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The internship is over and I am home in Muskegon, happy to use the weather as an excuse to spend entire days reading in coffeeshops.  I am leaving for Japan on September 5th and my Japanese is very rusty, and there is plenty of IR and political theory I would like to cover before school starts in late September. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This should be a wonderful week: home, family, friends, books, bowling, Muskegon, running on the lake.  August continues to be the best month yet this year for me - every side of life is good and I am excited about the future.  I love my apartment and roommates in Chicago, am in great shape for the cross-country season that starts next week, have read three new favorite novels over the past month (Steinbeck&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Travels with Charley &lt;/em&gt;along with Knut Hamsun&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Growth of the Soil &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Pan&lt;/em&gt;), am satisfied with my now-completed internship, and will be in Tokyo in two and a half weeks.  Things are very, very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The summer was difficult, not least because it was my first experience of working 50 hours a week in an office - that&amp;rsquo;s a pretty big leap from academic life.  But I learned an incredible amount; it often felt like I was being paid to go to school.  Every day, I read &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; practically cover to cover as well as pages upon pages of other news sources, academic papers, and economic forecasts.  My discussions about economics with my supervisors - emerging market bond portfolio managers - felt like private office hours with a great professor.  I observed the way Wall Street functions and the way investment decisions are made by institutional investors.  I learned how bonds work and how political risk affects investment decisions, and developed a spreadsheet to quantify the effect of political risk on developing countries&amp;rsquo; creditworthiness.  I created economic forecasts for Brazil, Russia, India and China.  I learned about currency fluctuations, liquidity, the subprime mortgage meltdown, current accounts, economic indicators - and much more.  Every day, I was bombarded with information. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoyed some aspects of the job more than others, and found that my background had left me better prepared for the political risk analysis side of the work than for the economic forecasting and modeling side of the work.  But I also gained a new respect for the power and complexity of financial markets, and I realized that if one&amp;rsquo;s goal is to understand the world in order to improve it, it is crucial to study markets as well as politics.  Political decisions create the space and the incentive structure in which markets function, but it is useful to think of politics and markets as intertwined and inseparable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a long way to go and a lot to study on all fronts, which is a major reason why I am grateful for this week of peace at home in West Michigan. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final quotes from Hamsun&amp;rsquo;s &lt;/em&gt;Growth of the Soil - &lt;em&gt;right up there with &lt;/em&gt;The Brothers Karamazov, Anna Karenina, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; War and Peace &lt;em&gt;as one of the absolute best novels I have ever gotten my hands on.  This book, like the others just mentioned, has reshaped the way I think and will hopefully reshape the way I live - it has inspired me to look away from the temptation of great wealth and great expectations, avoid being another rootless young person floating around the world&amp;rsquo;s cities, investigate rather than avoid the issue of abortion and find ways to reduce it, and be content with making and spending less and leaving a lighter footprint on earth.  Check the book out &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Growth-Soil-Knut-Hamsun/dp/0143105108/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-3421197-6377666?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1187556118&amp;sr=8-1&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; on Amazon.com.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why could not folk go on living as well or as poorly now as before there had been any mine at all?  Well, they could not, and that was all about it.  They had grown accustomed to better food, finer bread, store-bought clothes and higher wages, general extravagance - aye, folk had learned to reckon with money more, that was the matter.  And now the money was gone again, had slipped away like a shoal of herring out to sea - &amp;lsquo;twas dire distress for them all, and what was to be done?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inger has made her stormy voyage, &amp;lsquo;tis true, has lived in a city a while, but now she is home; the world is wide, swarming with tiny specks - Inger has been one of them.  All but nothing in all humanity, only one speck.  Then comes the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing growing there?  All things growing there; men and beasts and fruit of the soil.  Isak sowing his grain.  The evening sunlight falls on the grain that flashes out in an arc from his hand, and falls like a dropping of gold to the ground.  &amp;hellip; Forest and field look on.  All is majesty and power - a sequence and purpose of things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A man of the wild was not put out by the thought of great things he could not get; art, newspapers, luxuries, politics and such-like were worth just what folk were willing to pay for them, no more.  Growth of the soil was something different, a thing to be procured at any cost; the only source, the origin of all.  A dull and desolate existence?  Nay, least of all.  A man had everything; his powers above, his dreams, his loves, his wealth of superstition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There you are, living in touch with heaven and earth, one with them, one with all these wide, deep-rooted things.  No need of a sword in your hands, you go through life bareheaded, barehanded, in the midst of a great kindliness.  Look, Nature&amp;rsquo;s there, for you and yours to have and enjoy.  Man and Nature don&amp;rsquo;t bombard each other, but agree; they don&amp;rsquo;t compete, race one against the other, but go together.  &amp;hellip; Fjeld and forest, moors and meadow, and sky and stars - oh, &amp;lsquo;tis not poor and sparingly counted out, but without measure.  Listen to me, Sivert: you be content!  You&amp;rsquo;ve everything to live on, everything to live for, everything to believe in; being born and bringing forth, you are the needful on earth.  &amp;lsquo;Tis not all that are so, but you are so; needful on earth.  &amp;lsquo;Tis you that maintain life.  Generation to generation, breeding ever anew; and when you die, the new stock goes on.  That&amp;rsquo;s the meaning of eternal life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knut Hamsun&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;em&gt;Growth of the Soil&lt;/em&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&amp;mdash;

      <title>A personal update and four quotes</title>
      <link>http://ryanmccarl.com/post/a-personal-update-and-four-quotes/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 27 Jul 2007 00:16:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am excited about the weekend. I&amp;rsquo;ll be walking straight from work to Union Station tomorrow afternoon, and then the usual, happy routine of a quick trip home: the #370 &lt;em&gt;Pere Marquette &lt;/em&gt;accompanied by caffeine and books (and, since it&amp;rsquo;s summer, a wonderful sunset over the harbor in St. Joseph, MI), a late-night outing to Pints &amp;amp; Quarts and Pablo&amp;rsquo;s Tacos with Muskegon friends, a Saturday morning trip to eat breakfast and shop for used books in Grand Haven, a few intense games of ping-pong with Tyler, and a run on the beach. Early Sunday morning, I&amp;rsquo;ll be on the return train to Chicago and it will all seem surreal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two unique and wonderful things about this trip. First: my family got a new dog, a black retriever named Maggie, whom I will have the pleasure of meeting for the first time tomorrow night. And second: on Saturday night, two friends and I are going to a Counting Crows and Collective Soul concert in Grand Rapids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;mdash; &lt;em&gt;Quotes from tonight&amp;rsquo;s reading: &amp;mdash;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I am saying is this: the score is not what matters. Life does not have to be regarded as a game in which scores are kept and somebody wins. If you are too intent on winning, you will never enjoy playing. If you are too obsessed with success, you will forget to live. If you have learned only how to be a success, your life has probably been wasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thomas Merton&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;&amp;ldquo;Love and Living&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When that time was over and the good-bys said, I had to go through the same lost loneliness all over again, and it was no less painful than at first. There seemed to be no cure for loneliness save only being alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John Steinbeck&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash; &lt;em&gt;Travels with Charley&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;From &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blackberries for Amelia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the far stars, of which we now are told&lt;br /&gt;That ever faster they do bolt away,&lt;br /&gt;And that a night may come in which, some say,&lt;br /&gt;We shall have only blackness to behold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no time for any change so great,&lt;br /&gt;But I shall see the August weather spur&lt;br /&gt;Berries to ripen where the flowers were -&lt;br /&gt;Dark berries, savage-sweet and worth the wait -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And there will come the moment to be quick&lt;br /&gt;And save some from the birds, and I shall need&lt;br /&gt;Two pails, old clothes in which to stain and bleed,&lt;br /&gt;And a grandchild to talk with while we pick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-&lt;em&gt;Richard Wilbur&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can only imagine that the lonely man peoples his driving dreams with friends, that the loveless man surrounds himself with lovely loving women, and that children climb through the dreaming of the childless driver. And how about the areas of regrets? If only I had done so-and-so, or had not said such-and-such - my God, the damn thing might not have happened. Finding this potential in my own mind, I can suspect it in others, but I will never know, for no one ever tells. And this is why, on my journey which was designed for observation, I stayed as much as possible on secondary roads where there was much to see and hear and smell, and avoided the great wide traffic slashes which promote the self by fostering daydreams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John Steinbeck&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;em&gt;Travels with Charley&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&amp;mdash;

      <title>Poems &amp; fragments by Anna Akhmatova</title>
      <link>http://ryanmccarl.com/post/poems--fragments-by-anna-akhmatova/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 04 Jul 2007 03:29:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Happy Independence Day!  I&amp;rsquo;ll be spending a lazy Fourth revelling in freedom from work, sitting on the back porch with my roommates, and reading like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just discovered Anna Akhmatova, a Russian poet who wrote and published under the specter of Soviet communism and Stalinism; her husband of eleven years was shot in 1921 as a &amp;ldquo;counter-revolutionary,&amp;rdquo; her son and lover were arrested and sent to labor camps, and she herself was regularly persecuted and followed by the secret police.  I picked Akhmatova&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Selected Poems&lt;/em&gt; up on a whim during my last trip to Cheapstacks in Grand Haven, MI, and she has immediately become one of my favorite poets.  Some of the poems below are complete, others are excerpts - most of her poems have dates rather than titles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;br /&gt;O there are words that should not be repeated,&lt;br /&gt;And he who speaks them - is a spendthrift.&lt;br /&gt;Inexhaustible is the sky&amp;rsquo;s blue spindrift&lt;br /&gt;Alone, and the mercy of the Redeemer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now mirrors learn&lt;br /&gt;Not to expect smiles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bays broke the low shore,&lt;br /&gt;Boats ran out to sea,&lt;br /&gt;And I&amp;rsquo;d dry my salty hair&lt;br /&gt;On a flat rock a mile from land.&lt;br /&gt;Swam to me the green fish,&lt;br /&gt;Flew to me the white seagull,&lt;br /&gt;I was gay, and bold, and wicked,&lt;br /&gt;And never knew I was happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on without end - the day, heavy and amber!&lt;br /&gt;How impossible is grief, how vain the waiting!&lt;br /&gt;And with a silver voice, again the deer&lt;br /&gt;Speaks in the deer-park of the Northern Lights.&lt;br /&gt;And I believe that there is cool snow,&lt;br /&gt;And a blue font for those whose hands are empty,&lt;br /&gt;And a small sledge is being wildly ridden,&lt;br /&gt;Under the ancient chimes of distant bells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Under an empty dwelling&amp;rsquo;s frozen roof,&lt;br /&gt;Dead days.  Here no living comes.&lt;br /&gt;I read the Acts of the Apostles&lt;br /&gt;And the Psalms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the stars are blue, the hoar-frost downy,&lt;br /&gt;And each morning more wonderful,&lt;br /&gt;And in the Bible a red maple leaf&lt;br /&gt;Marks the pages of the Song of Songs.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&amp;mdash;
