They come from Buffalo and Chicago and the Far West, through Albany and down along the river in the early morning, and at one time or another I&amp;rsquo;ve traveled on most of them, and I lay in the dark thinking about the polar air in the Pullman cars and the smell of nightclothes and the taste of dining-car water and the way it feels to end a day in Cleveland or Chicago and begin another in New York, particularly after you&amp;rsquo;ve been away for a couple of years, and particularly in the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;I took the eight-ten train into town in the morning and returned on the six-thirty.  I knew enough to avoid the empty house in the summer dusk, and I drove directly from the station parking lot to a good restaurant called Orpheo&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;&amp;ldquo;The Cure&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ldquo;The sun is in your hair.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ldquo;What?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ldquo;The sun is in your hair.  It&amp;rsquo;s a beautiful color.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;&amp;ldquo;The Chaste Clarissa&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name=&#39;more&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt that he was a captive of financial and sentimental commitments, like every other man I know, and that he was no more free to fall in love with a strange woman he saw on a street corner than he was to take a walking trip through French Guiana or to recommence his life in Chicago under an assumed name.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ldquo;Is divorce so dreadful and of all the things that hold a marriage together how many of them are good?&amp;rdquo; She sat down at the table.  &amp;ldquo;In Grenoble,&amp;rdquo; she said, &amp;ldquo;I wrote a long paper on Charles Stuart in French.  A professor at the University of Chicago wrote me a letter.  I couldn&amp;rsquo;t read a French newspaper without a dictionary today, I don&amp;rsquo;t have the time to follow any newspaper, and I am ashamed of my incompetence, ashamed of the way I look.  Oh, I guess I love you, I do love the children, but I love myself, I love my life, it has some value and some promise for me and Trencher&amp;rsquo;s roses make me feel that I&amp;rsquo;m losing this, that I&amp;rsquo;m losing my self-respect.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Walking down Lexington Avenue, we heard the drone bass of a church organ sound from the sky, and we and the others on the sidewalk looked up in piety and bewilderment, like a devout and stupid congregation, and saw a formation of heavy bombers heading for the sea.  As it got late, it got cold and clear and still, and on the stillness the waste from the smokestacks along the East River seemed to articulate, as legibly as the Pepsi-Cola plane, whole words and sentences.  Halcyon.  Disaster.  They were hard to make out.  It seemed the ebb of the year - an evil day for gastritis, sinus, and respiratory disease - and remembering other winters, the markings of the light convinced me that it was the season of divorce.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;I think that the seriousness of the day affected the children, and when they returned to the house, they were quiet.  The seriousness of it kept coming to me with the feeling that this change, like a phenomenon of speed, was affecting our watches as well as our hearts.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Now when I come home in the evenings, Ethel is still sitting on the stool by the sink cleaning vegetables.  I go with her into the children&amp;rsquo;s room.  The light there is bright.  The children have built something out an orange crate, something preposterous and ascendant, and their sweetness, their compulsion to build, the brightness of the light are reflected perfectly and increased in Ethel&amp;rsquo;s face.  Then she feeds them, bathes them, and sets the table, and stands for a moment in the middle of the room, trying to make some connection between the evening and the day.  Then it is over.  She lights the four candles, and we sit down to our supper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;&amp;ldquo;The Season of Divorce&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is true of even the best of us that if an observer can catch us boarding a train at a way station; if he will mark our faces, stripped by anxiety of their self-possession; if he will appraise our luggage, our clothing, and look out of the window to see who has driven us to the station; if he will listen to the harsh or tender things we say if we are with our families, or notice the way we put our suitcase onto the rack, check the position of our wallet, our key ring, and wipe the sweat off the back of our necks; if he can judge sensibly the self-importance, diffidence, or sadness with which we settle ourselves, he will be given a broader view of our lives than most of us would intend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;&amp;ldquo;The Summer Farmer&amp;rdquo;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&amp;mdash;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;From&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Next Day&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wisdom, said William James,&lt;br /&gt;Is learning what to overlook.  And I am wise&lt;br /&gt;If that is wisdom.&lt;br /&gt;Yet somehow, as I buy All from these shelves&lt;br /&gt;And the boy takes it to my station wagon,&lt;br /&gt;What I&amp;rsquo;ve become&lt;br /&gt;Troubles me even if I shut my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Imaginings within my imagining,&lt;br /&gt;I too have taken&lt;br /&gt;The chance of life.  Now the boy pats my dog&lt;br /&gt;And we start home.  Now I am good.&lt;br /&gt;The last mistaken,&lt;br /&gt;Ecstatic, accidental bliss, the blind&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happiness that, bursting, leaves upon the palm&lt;br /&gt;Some soap and water -&lt;br /&gt;It was so long ago&amp;hellip;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;Randall Jarrell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The overt Godlessness of our world is a latent Godliness.  To an eye keen for things theological, religion is most present where it is least visible.  That &amp;ldquo;secularism&amp;rdquo; blinds us to the theological order everywhere implicit in the secular order is the &amp;ldquo;central&amp;rdquo; player in (Mark C.) Taylor&amp;rsquo;s dialectic.  &lt;em&gt;After God&lt;/em&gt; is full of illuminating narratives generated by this hypothesis, the central story being how much &amp;ldquo;modernity&amp;rdquo; goes back to the Reformation: Luther&amp;rsquo;s assertion of subjectivity, his rejection of tradition in favor of personal experience, his media-savvy insistence on the vernacular and use of the printing press&amp;hellip;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John D. Caputo&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;ndash;Review of Mark C. Taylor&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;After God&lt;/em&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The Journal of the American Academy of Religion&lt;/em&gt; 77:1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look not too long in the face of the fire, O man! Never dream with thy hand on the helm! Turn not thy back to the compass; accept the first hint of the hitching tiller; believe not the artificial fire, when its redness makes all things look ghastly. To-morrow, in the natural sun, the skies will be bright; those who glared like devils in the forking flames, the morn will show in far other, at least gentler, relief; the glorious, golden, glad sun, the only true lamp - all others but liars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless the sun hides not Virginia&amp;rsquo;s Dismal Swamp, nor Rome&amp;rsquo;s accursed Campagna, nor wide Sahara, nor all the millions of miles of deserts and of griefs beneath the moon. The sun hides not the ocean, which is the dark side of this earth, and which is two thirds of this earth. So, therefore, that mortal man who hath more of joy than sorrow in him, that mortal man cannot be true - not true, or undeveloped. With books the same. The truest of all men was the Man of Sorrows, and the truest of all books is Solomon&amp;rsquo;s, and Ecclesiastes is the fine hammered steel of woe. &amp;ldquo;All is vanity.&amp;rdquo; ALL.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;There is a wisdom that is woe; but there is a woe that is madness. And there is a Catskill eagle in some souls that can alike dive down into the blackest gorges, and soar out of them again and become invisible in the sunny spaces. And even if he for ever flies within the gorge, that gorge is in the mountains; so that even in his lowest swoop the mountain eagle is still higher than other birds upon the plain, even though they soar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Herman Melville&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;ndash;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.princeton.edu/~batke/moby/&#34;&gt;Moby-Dick&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;From&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;90 North&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see at last that all the knowledge&lt;br /&gt;I wrung from the darkness - that the darkness flung me -&lt;br /&gt;Is worthless as ignorance: nothing comes from nothing,&lt;br /&gt;The darkness from the darkness.  Pain comes from the darkness&lt;br /&gt;And we call it wisdom.  It is pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;Randall Jarrell&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&amp;mdash;

      <title>The science of happiness</title>
      <link>http://ryanmccarl.com/post/the-science-of-happiness/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 27 Apr 2008 13:42:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://ryanmccarl.com/post/the-science-of-happiness/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Excerpts from Richard Layard&amp;rsquo;s &lt;span style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;Happiness: Lessons from a New Science&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The extra happiness provided by extra income is greatest when you are poor, and declines steadily as you get richer.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ldquo;Required income&amp;rdquo; varies strongly with the actual income that an individual currently experiences.  A dollar rise in experienced income causes a rise of at least a forty cents in &amp;ldquo;required income.&amp;rdquo;  So when I earn an extra dollar this year, it makes me happier, but next year I shall measure my income from a benchmark that is forty cents higher.  In this sense at least 40% of this year&amp;rsquo;s gain is &amp;ldquo;wiped out&amp;rdquo; next year.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Differences in family situation cause a huge difference in happiness.  If someone is divorced, that person&amp;rsquo;s happiness falls by 5 (percentage) points.  This is more than double the effect of losing a third of one&amp;rsquo;s income.  &amp;hellip;The year of divorce is the worst.  After that year men return on average to their baseline level of happiness, but women continue to suffer.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;If our goals are too low, we get bored.  But if they are too high, we get frustrated.  The secret is to have goals that are stretching enough, but not too stretching.  Unattainable goals are a well-known cause of depression.  But so too is boredom.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;The typical Briton watches television for three and a half hours a day - roughly twenty-five hours a week.  Over a lifetime a typical Briton spends more time watching television than doing paid work.  The figures are much the same in the United States.  &amp;hellip; This viewing time has to come from somewhere, and it mainly comes from social life.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;So how does the content of television affect our feelings about life, and our behavior?  If television simply mirrored life as it is, it would be unlikely to have much effect.  However, it does not simply mirror life - that would be boring.  Television focuses far more on the extremes.  It contains far more violence, sex, and chaotic relationships than ordinary life does, and it contains far more wealth and beauty.  &amp;hellip;Chaos on the screen tends to desensitize - to make people more willing to engage in violence themselves and in illicit sex.  At the same time wealth and beauty create discontent with what people have - an itch to earn or steal more wealth, or to find a more beautiful partner.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;On one estimate an extra hour a week watching television causes you to spend an extra $4 a week - on &amp;ldquo;keeping up with the Joneses.&amp;rdquo;  &amp;hellip;It reduces our happiness with our possessions.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Viewing may also reduce our happiness with our bodies, and with our spouses.  The psychologist Douglas Kenrick showed women a series of female models.  He evaluated their mood before and after they looked at the pictures.  After seeing the models, the women&amp;rsquo;s mood fell.  So how must women&amp;rsquo;s moods be affected by television?  In three hours of viewing television each day you cannot fail to see a parade of beautiful women.  What about the effect on men?  As part of the same series of experiments, pictures of models were shown to a sample of men.  Kenrick evaluated their feelings about their wives before and after each presentation.  After seeing the models, most men felt less good about their wives.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Trustworthiness is crucial in any venture, and no long-term contract can flourish except on the basis of commitment to the common goal.  This applies in business, in friendship or in marriage.  Unfortunately, the growth of individualism has encouraged a short-term version of &lt;span style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;contractarian&lt;/span&gt; thinking, where more and more decisions are conducted on the basis of a short-term quid pro quo. &amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this environment of continuous reoptimization, it is not surprising that, as we have seen, people are less satisfied with their marriages.  There is also clear evidence that when spouses arrange their lives on the basis of quid pro quo, they are less satisfied with the marriage than when it is based on the concept of giving.  &amp;hellip;The evidence also shows that when one spouse does something and the other spouse reciprocates, the first gets less satisfaction than when no direct reciprocation occurs.  This is because giving confers satisfaction, and can confer more satisfaction than taking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Above all, we need to know that our partner has sufficient emotional commitment to the enterprise.  If so, we know the partner will stick to the relationship, even when short-term advantage would say &amp;ldquo;Out.&amp;rdquo;  &amp;hellip;If both parties know that the other is really committed, each will invest more and the probability of success will rise.  In all walks of life, good behavior by one person elicits good behavior by others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Richard Layard&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;Happiness: Lessons from a New Science&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&amp;mdash;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;-Happy &lt;a href=&#34;http://youtube.com/watch?v=PbUtL_0vAJk&#34;&gt;Martin Luther King Jr.&lt;/a&gt; Day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honest and earnest criticism from those whose interests are most nearly touched - criticism of writers by readers, of government by those governed, of leaders by those led - this is the soul of democracy and the safeguard of modern society.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;In fact the burden belongs to the nation, and the hands of none of us are clean if we bend not our energies to righting these wrongs.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;The opposition to Negro education in the South was at first bitter, and showed itself in ashes, insult, and blood; for the South believed an educated Negro to be a dangerous Negro.  And the South was not wholly wrong; for education among all kinds of men always has had, and always will have, an element of danger and revolution, of dissatisfaction and discontent.  Nevertheless, men strive to know.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;To be a poor man is hard, but to be a poor race in a land of dollars is the very bottom of hardships.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;W.E.B. Du Bois&lt;br /&gt; &amp;ndash;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Souls-Black-Norton-Critical-Editions/dp/039397393X/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1200937222&amp;amp;sr=1-2&#34;&gt;The Souls of Black Folk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His emotion had made him a boy again, a child sitting quietly with folded arms.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lsquo;It&amp;rsquo;s spring, I&amp;rsquo;m walking into the new season,&amp;rsquo; Rolandsen answered over his shoulder as he went by.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, he was not God, he could not contain his heart if it insisted on flying away in the spring.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;The nights too were bright and sunny.  It was weather for dreamers, for young people to flit about in restless excitement.  They wandered the roads at night, singing and beating the air with sallow-twigs.  And from all the isles and skerries came the sound of birds: guillemots and oyster-catchers and gulls and eiderducks.  The seal thrust his dripping head up out of the water and looked around, then dived back down again to his own world.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;He went to the sexton&amp;rsquo;s house to look for Olga.  Now that it was spring Rolandsen had to have a sweetheart; it was no easy matter to hold his own great heart in check.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Alas, Rolandsen was ever hopeful; it took very little to rouse his expectations.  But it had to be admitted that he was also good at bearing disappointments; he was proud and resilient and his spirit was never broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knut Hamsun&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;ndash;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Dreamers-Directions-Classics-Knut-Hamsun/dp/0811213218&#34;&gt;Dreamers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people are always getting a bigger boat, but rarely sail.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;All these books boil down to the same message: &amp;lsquo;Resist the urge to buy.&amp;rsquo;  Once you learn how to do it, it becomes second nature.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Most people find that stuff does indeed expand to fill the space provided.  Do you want to encourage this tendency with the stuff in your house?  Extra space will cost you in several ways: money and times to decorate, clean, and maintain; energy to heat and cool all that space; and outdoor space (the more you put under roof, the less you&amp;rsquo;ll have outside).  There&amp;rsquo;s also the house law of diminishing returns: the difference between having one bathroom or none is enormous, but between two or three may be negligible.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Living smaller frees up&amp;hellip;time and money to pursue fun.  Having good friends is a proven mood elevator.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Polls show that most Americans believe we must earn about twice the median income to be solidly middle class - that is, we believe that what we earn, on average, is just not enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shay Salomon and Nigel Valdez&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;ndash;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Little-House-Small-Planet-Possibilities/dp/1592288685/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1200937031&amp;amp;sr=8-1&#34;&gt;Little House on a Small Planet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&amp;mdash;

      <title>Knut Hamsun&#39;s &#39;Pan&#39;</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_dbkE5wB5Kaw/RrWND9ughiI/AAAAAAAAAEM/_4c5MCTKreE/s1600-h/Knut_Hamsun.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img id=&#34;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5095133652688340514&#34; style=&#34;FLOAT: left; MARGIN: 0px 10px 10px 0px; CURSOR: hand&#34; alt=&#39;&#34; src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_dbkE5wB5Kaw/RrWND9ughiI/AAAAAAAAAEM/_4c5MCTKreE/s400/Knut_Hamsun.jpg&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just finished the best novel I&amp;rsquo;ve read in a very long time. I am stunned at how beautiful &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knut_Hamsun&#34;&gt;Knut Hamsun&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s writing is, and cannot believe that he is not a household name in America. He was a very flawed man - like Martin Heidegger, Carl Schmitt, and too many others, he abused his considerable intellectual gifts in support of Nazism, and it is understandable that this removed his right to a full place in the Great Books pantheon. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the same, however, he is an incredible writer whose work deserves to be a standard on classics lists. &lt;em&gt;Pan &lt;/em&gt;was a truly special read, and I am going to read as many of his novels as I can get my hands on. Here are some excerpts to give you a taste:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a big, white-washed house down by the sea, I met someone who for a short while filled my thoughts. She is no longer always in my memory, not now - no, I have quite forgotten her. But I do recall the other things, the cries of the sea birds, the hunting in the forest, my nights, and all the warm hours of the summer. It was in any case by sheer chance that I met her; and had it not been for that chance she would never have lain in my thoughts for a single day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For it is within ourselves that the sources of joy and sorrow lie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a boulder outside my hut, a big grey boulder. It always seemed by its expression to be well-disposed towards me; it was as if it saw me as I came past and knew me again. I used to like making my way past this boulder when I went out in the mornings, and it was as though I left a good friend there who would be waiting when I got back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some days a chill atmosphere of unrest hung over the earth; rotten branches snapped and the crows collected in flocks and squawked. But it was not for long, the sun was near; one morning it rose up behind the forest. A sweet pang strikes through me when the sun comes; I throw my gun on my shoulder in silent rejoicing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed every bend, taking my time; there was no hurry and nobody was waiting for me at home. Free as a king I went my way in the peace of the forest, as leisurely as I pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everywhere the sky was open and pure. I gazed into the clear sea and it was as if I lay face to face with the depths of the earth, and as if my beating heart went out to those depths and was at home there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;More excerpts to come; all of the above beauties were in the first ten pages of the 192 page book. A &lt;/em&gt;New Yorker&lt;em&gt; article about Hamsun can be found &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/12/26/051226crat_atlarge&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and the book can be purchased &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Pan-Knut-Hamsun/dp/1406937932/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-0086905-3665754?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1186303891&amp;amp;sr=8-1&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I give it my highest recommendation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&amp;mdash;

      <title>Quotes from Thomas Merton and John Steinbeck</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Living is more than submission: it is creation.  To live is to create one&amp;rsquo;s own world as a scene of personal happiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Thomas Merton, &amp;ldquo;The Street is For Celebration&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Celebration is the beginning of confidence, therefore of power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Thomas Merton, &amp;ldquo;The Street is For Celebration&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next passage in my journey is a love affair.  I am in love with Montana.  For other states I have admiration, respect, recognition, even some affection, but with Montana it is love, and it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to analyze love when you&amp;rsquo;re in it.  &amp;hellip; It seems to me that Montana is a great splash of grandeur.  The scale is huge but not overpowering.  The land is rich with grass and color, and the mountains are the kind I would create if mountains were ever put on my agenda.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;The calm of the mountains and the rolling grasslands had got into the inhabitants.  It was hunting season when I drove through the state.  The men I talked to seemed to me not moved to a riot of seasonal slaughter but simply to be going out to kill edible meat.  Again my attitude may be informed by love, but it seemed to me that the towns were places to live in rather than nervous hives.  People had time to pause in their occupations to undertake the passing art of neighborliness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-John Steinbeck, &lt;em&gt;Travels with Charley&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When we live superficially, when we are always outside ourselves, never quite &amp;ldquo;with&amp;rdquo; ourselves, always divided and pulled in many directions by conflicting plans and projects, we find ourselves doing many things that we do not really want to do, saying things we do not really mean, needing things we do not really need, exhausting ourselves for what we secretly realize to be worthless and without meaning in our lives: &amp;ldquo;Why spend your money on what is not food and your earnings on what never satisfies?&amp;rdquo; (Isaiah 55:2)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Thomas Merton, &amp;ldquo;Creative Silence&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having a companion fixes you in time and that the present, but when the quality of aloneness settles down, past, present, and future all flow together.  A memory, a present event, and a forecast all equally present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-John Steinbeck, &lt;em&gt;Travels with Charley&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the long run, the discipline of creative silence demands a certain kind of faith.  For when we come face to face with ourselves in the lonely ground of our own being, we confront many questions about the value of our existence, the reality of our commitments, the authenticity of our everyday lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Thomas Merton, &amp;ldquo;Creative Silence&amp;rdquo;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&amp;mdash;
