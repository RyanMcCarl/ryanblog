      <title>Howard Zinn on World War II</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve intended to read Howard Zinn&amp;rsquo;s revisionist history of the United States - &lt;em&gt;A People&amp;rsquo;s History of the United States&lt;/em&gt; - for years, and I finally buckled down and started it this week. It is an excellent and eye-opening book, to say the least, and I found myself becoming absorbed in and largely agreeing with the narrative of the first few chapters - his interpretation of the &amp;ldquo;discovery&amp;rdquo; and colonization of America. Although I&amp;rsquo;m usually not willing to follow Zinn to his ultimate conclusions, I find his eagerness to tear down the myths and falsehoods surrounding the idea of &amp;ldquo;American exceptionalism&amp;rdquo; refreshing - especially after the nationalist fervor of a Presidential election season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zinn reminds us that Americans are fallible human beings like any others, capable of acts of greatness as well as acts of shame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I skipped ahead to find out what Zinn had to say about World War II - the war most often held up in America as an example of America&amp;rsquo;s unique greatness, of America-as-savior-and-beacon-of-hope. Here&amp;rsquo;s an excerpt from what I found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size:85%;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, if the entrance of the United States into World War II was (as so many Americans believed at the time, observing the Nazi invasions) to defend the principle of nonintervention in the affairs of other countries, the nation&amp;rsquo;s record cast doubt on its ability to uphold that principle.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;.&lt;br /&gt;As Bruce Russett says: &amp;ldquo;Throughout the 1930s the United States government had done little to resist the Japanese advance on the Asian continent.&amp;rdquo; But: &amp;ldquo;The Southwest Pacific area was of undeniable economic importance to the United States - at the time most of America&amp;rsquo;s tin and rubber came from there, as did substantial qualities of other raw materials.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;A State Department memorandum on Japanese expansion, a year before Pearl Harbor, did not talk of the independence of China or the principle of self-determination. It said: &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;our general diplomatic and strategic position would be considerably weakened - by our loss of Chinese, Indian, and South Seas markets (and by our loss of much of the Japanese market for our goods, as Japan would become more and more self-sufficient) as well as by insurmountable restrictions upon our access to the rubber, tin, jute, and other vital materials of the Asian and Oceanic regions.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;The plight of Jews in German-occupied Europe, which many people thought was at the heart of the war against the Axis, was not a chief concern of Roosevelt.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Was the war being fought to establish that Hitler was wrong in his ideas of white Nordic supremacy over &amp;ldquo;inferior&amp;rdquo; races? The United States&amp;rsquo; armed forces were segregated by race.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;In one of its policies, the United States came close to direct duplication of Fascism. This was in its treatment of the Japanese-Americans living on the West Coast. After the Pearl Harbor attack, anti-Japanese hysteria spread in the government. One Congressman said: &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m for catching every Japanese in America, Alaska, and Hawaii now and putting them in concentration camps&amp;hellip;. Damn them! Let&amp;rsquo;s get rid of them!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Franklin D. Roosevelt did not share this frenzy, but he calmly signed Executive Order 9066, in February 1942, giving the army the power, without warrants or indictments or hearings, to arrest every Japanese-American on the West Coast - 110,000 men, women, and children - to take them from their homes, transport them to camps far into the interior, and keep them there under prison conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Hatred against the enemy, against the Japanese particularly, became widespread. Racism was clearly at work. &lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt; magazine, reporting the battle of Iwo Jima, said: &amp;ldquo;The ordinary unreasoning Jap is ignorant. Perhaps he is human. Nothing&amp;hellip;indicates it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, there was a mass base of support for what became the heaviest bombardment of civilians ever undertaken in any war: the aerial attacks on German and Japanese cities.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Italy had bombed cities in the Ethiopian war; Italy and germany had bombed civilians in the Spanish Civil War; at the start of World War II German planes dropped bombs on Rotterdam in Holland, Convetry in England, and elsewhere. Roosevelt had described these as &amp;ldquo;inhuman barbarism that has profoundly shocked the conscience of humanity.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These German bombings were very small compared with the British and American bombings of German cities. &amp;hellip;The English flew at night with no pretense of aiming at &amp;ldquo;military&amp;rdquo; targets; the Americans flew in the daytime and pretended precision, but bombing from high altitudes made that impossible. The climax of this terror bormbing was the bombing of Dresden in early 1945, in which the tremendous heat generated by the bombs created a vacuum into which fire leaped swiftly in a great firestorm through the city. More than 100,000 died in Dresden.

      <title>Readings from Mann, Golley, and Eliot</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;-Must-read: the &lt;span style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;New York Times&lt;/span&gt; on a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/24/us/24land.html?hp&#34;&gt;severe case of protracted bullying&lt;/a&gt;.  This is real, and it&amp;rsquo;s an enormous problem.  There is a spectrum of school violence ranging from verbal harassment and bullying all the way to school shootings, and it needs to be taken more seriously and addressed more quickly at every stage.  An atmosphere of security and mutual respect in classrooms is essential to students&amp;rsquo; well-being and ability to learn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A human being lives out not only his personal life as an individual, but also, consciously or subconsciously, the lives of his epoch and contemporaries.  &amp;hellip;All sorts of personal goals, purposes, hopes, prospects may float before the eyes of a given individual, from which he may then glean the impulse for exerting himself for great deeds; if the impersonal world around him, however, if the times themselves, despite all their hustle and bustle, provide him with neither hopes nor prospects, if they secretly supply him with evidence that things are in fact hopeless, without prospect or remedy, if the times respond with hollow silence to every conscious or subconscious question, however it may be posed, about the ultimate, unequivocal meaning of all exertions and deeds that are more than exclusively personal - then it is almost inevitable&amp;hellip;that the situation will have a crippling effect, which, following moral and spiritual paths, may even spread to that person&amp;rsquo;s physical and organic life.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Two days of travel separate this young man (and young he is, with few firm roots in life) from his everyday world, especially from what might be called his duties, interests, worries, and prospects - separate him far more than he had dreamed possible as he rode to the station in a hansom cab.  Space, as it rolls and tumbles away between him and his native soil, proves to have powers normally ascribed only to time; from hour to hour, space brings about changes very like those time produces, yet surpassing them in certain ways.  Space, like time, gives birth to forgetfulness, but does so by removing an individual from all relationships and placing him in a free and pristine state - indeed, in but a moment it can turn a pedant and a philistine into something like a vagabond.  Time, they say, is water from the river Lethe, but alien air is a similar drink; and if its effects are less profound, it works all the more quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thomas Mann&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;The Magic Mountain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ldquo;All divine attributes have been taken over by human hands,&amp;rdquo; (Hirato Renkichi) wrote.  &amp;ldquo;Today, the engine of God is the engine of the city, and partakes in the activities of humanity&amp;rsquo;s millions.&amp;rdquo;  Almost every sentence of this document seems to anticipate Paul Virilio&amp;rsquo;s 1997 equation of &amp;ldquo;new technologies&amp;rdquo; with the &amp;ldquo;three traditional characteristics of the Divine: ubiquity, instantaneity, and immediacy.&amp;rdquo;  Although Virilio refers here to a much later technological revolution, the logic of his thinking echoes the poetics of Hirato Renkichi.  &amp;hellip;For Hirato, the powers of the divine had come to reside in &amp;ldquo;the impulsive candor of the machine, in its light, its heat, its ceaseless rhythms.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gregory Golley&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;When Our Eyes No Longer See: Realism, Science, and Ecology in Japanese Literary Modernism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a poet&amp;rsquo;s mind is perfectly equipped for its work, it is constantly amalgamating disparate experience; the ordinary man&amp;rsquo;s experience is chaotic, irregular, fragmentary.  The latter falls in love, or reads Spinoza, and these two experiences have nothing to do with each other, or with the noise of the typewriter or the smell of cooking; in the mind of the poet these experiences are always forming new wholes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;T.S. Eliot&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;&amp;ldquo;The Metaphysical Poets,&amp;rdquo; quoted in Golley, &lt;span style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;When Our Eyes No Longer See&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&amp;mdash;

      <title>Readings on Easter, Just War Theory, and Japanese lit</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Happy Easter! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The resurrection of Jesus is the sign to the world that God indeed does reign, does give life in death and that the love of God is stronger even than death (Rom. 8:36-39).&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;At the center of the church&amp;rsquo;s teaching on peace and at the center of all Catholic social teaching, are the transcendence of God and the dignity of the human person.  The human person is the clearest reflection of God&amp;rsquo;s presence in the world; all of the church&amp;rsquo;s work in pursuit of both justice and peace is designed to protect and promote the dignity of every person.  For each person not only reflects God, but is the expression of God&amp;rsquo;s creative work and the meaning of Christ&amp;rsquo;s redemptive ministry.  Christians approach the problem of war and peace with fear and reverence.  God is the Lord of life, and so each human life is sacred; modern warfare threatens the obliteration of human life on a previously unimaginable scale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;U.S. Catholic Bishops&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;ndash;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;The Challenge of Peace: God&amp;rsquo;s Promise and Our Response (The Pastoral Letter on War and Peace, 1983)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.  &lt;span id=&#34;en-NIV-28140&#34; class=&#34;sup&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, &lt;span id=&#34;en-NIV-28141&#34; class=&#34;sup&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Romans 8:37-39&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The aggressor is always peace-loving; he would prefer to take over our country unopposed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Carl Von Clausewitz, quoted in J.T. Turner, &amp;ldquo;Threats, Values and Defense: Does the Defense of Values by Force Remain a Moral Possibility?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His desire for a woman was not of a sort to make him want this particular woman - it was something to be taken care of lightly and with no sense of guilt.  This woman was too clean.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;The window of the waiting-room was clear for an instant as the train started to move.  Komako&amp;rsquo;s face glowed forth, and as quickly disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;But this love would leave behind it nothing so definite as a piece of Chijimi.  Though cloth to be worn is among the most short-lived of craftworks, a good piece of Chijimi, if it has been taken care of, can be worn quite unfaded a half-century and more after weaving.  As Shimamura thought absently how human intricacies have not even so long a life, the image of Komako as the mother of another man&amp;rsquo;s children suddenly floated into his mind.  He looked around, startled.  Possibly he was tired.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;He leaned against the brazier, provided against the coming of the snowy season, and thought how unlikely it was that he would come again once he had left.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Komako had come up to him, he did not know when.  She took his hand.  He looked around at her but said nothing.  She gazed at the fire, the pulse of the fire beating on her intent, slightly flushed face.  Shimamura felt a violent rising in his chest.  Komako&amp;rsquo;s hair was coming undone, and her throat was bare and arched.  His fingers trembled from the urge to touch it.  His hand was warm, but Komako&amp;rsquo;s was still warmer.  He did not know why he should feel that a separation was forcing itself upon them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kawabata Yasunari&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;ndash;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;Snow Country&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously he did not much enjoy reading and discussing a typical month&amp;rsquo;s production of Japanese literature.  In a 1935 essay Kobayashi expressed his annoyance with authors who complained that he had not been sufficiently kind in his reviews, and asked sardonically what kindness contemporary authors have ever shown their critics.  The only kindness a critic really wants from authors is that they will supply him with the basis for writing decent criticism; but present-day authors do precisely the opposite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Donald Keene&lt;br /&gt; &amp;ndash;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;Dawn to the West: A History of Japanese Literature (Vol. 4)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&amp;mdash;

The mountains truly stretch on and on, and white clouds lie piled on the peaks. A smoky rain buried the valleys, here and there interrupted by the huts of the mountain folk, very small. To the west, the sound of a tree being felled; to the east, the echo. The voices of the bells of many temples found a response deep in my heart.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Weary of sleeping every night in strange lodgings, I got up from bed while it was still dark and went out onto the beach.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;As the days went by in travel, untying my straw sandals at this place and laying down my walking stick at that, the year drew to a close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Basho (tr.

It&amp;rsquo;s a 12-hour flight and a 13-hour difference from eastern time, so I&amp;rsquo;ll arrive in Tokyo around 4 pm on Thursday.  Then, I&amp;rsquo;ll figure out how to ride the bus from Narita to Shinjuku, the district in the photo, and at Shinjuku I&amp;rsquo;ll meet up with my friend Ai.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I became friends with Ai when she was an exchange student in my hometown of Muskegon, MI, during my senior year of high school; although I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen her in over three years, we&amp;rsquo;ve kept in touch through letters and emails.  I&amp;rsquo;ll be staying with Ai and making the most of Tokyo for two weeks, seeing as much as I can and improving my Japanese as much as possible in the process. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Sunday, I&amp;rsquo;ll also spend the day with the Takada family, the wonderful host parents and sisters I stayed with for six weeks as an exchange student near Tokyo in the summer before my senior year of high school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Naturally, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to spend any of this precious time typing in English and surfing the Internet.  So the blog is on hiatus until September 20th or so.  Thank you, as always, for reading, and feel free to browse the archives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, I will take hundreds of photos and keep a detailed travel journal these next two weeks, and I will post some of that on this blog when I return.  Until then:  &lt;em&gt;Ja, ne.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&amp;mdash;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For whom, he thought, that splendor?  For me alone?&lt;br /&gt;Yet it will be here long after I perish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Czeslaw Milosz, from &amp;ldquo;Study of Loneliness&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.  Remember those who are in prison, as though in prison with them; and those who are ill-treated, since you are also in the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Hebrews 13:1-3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The behavior of individual consumers and producers in the rational pursuit of their objectives is governed by the principle of marginal utility, or marginality.  On the demand side of the economy, according to marginal-utility analysis, as consumers consume more and more of a good they experience diminishing utility; that is, while the first ice cream sundae consumed may be devoured with great pleasure, each additional sundae provides less pleasure (decreasing utility) and the demand of the individual for more sundaes decreases.  &amp;hellip; The one possible exception to the principle of marginal utility, at least for most individuals, is the desire for wealth itself, a desire that appears insatiable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Robert Gilpin, &lt;em&gt;Global Political Economy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sense of belonging that bound the villagers to their village community was reinforced by social and economic factors.  Population movements among the rural population were slight.  Most families had lived in their villages as far back as memory could stretch, and membership in the village was a kind of birthright.  This population stability over generations created a sense of local roots that is now unimaginable in highly mobile American society, where people change jobs and houses at the drop of a hat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Peter Duus, &lt;em&gt;The Rise of Modern Japan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Hebrews 11:1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;day draws near&lt;br /&gt;another one&lt;br /&gt;do what you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Czeslaw Milosz, from &amp;ldquo;On Angels&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just because people were diligent did not mean they had to be abstemious.  Enjoyment was not to be repressed, a notion associated with traditional American attitudes toward work and achievement, but rather to be put in its proper place.  The pursuit of pleasure, sexual and otherwise, was regarded as natural and inevitable, to be condemned only when it threatened to put diligence and frugality behind it.  Thus it was possible, as one recent observer has noted, for the Japanese to be Protestant by day and Mediterranean by night, an enviable cultural compromise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Peter Duus, &lt;em&gt;The Rise of Modern Japan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&amp;mdash;

      <title>Poems from the Far East</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My recent fascination with Korean poetry continues, and tonight I spent an hour or two reading Japanese poetry as well.  Here&amp;rsquo;s a small sample of what I found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sad creature, neck stretched out;&lt;br /&gt;Dignified always, you say nothing at all.&lt;br /&gt;With your crown so fragrant,&lt;br /&gt;Yours was too noble a clan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you stare into the depths&lt;br /&gt;And think of lost legends,&lt;br /&gt;In overwhelming sadness, you turn your neck&lt;br /&gt;And look toward mountains far away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;No Ch’onmyong&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Silent, but…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may be silent, but&lt;br /&gt;I’m thinking.&lt;br /&gt;I may not talk, but&lt;br /&gt;Don’t mistake me for a wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tsuboi Shigeji&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through the train window,&lt;br /&gt;Far away to the north,&lt;br /&gt;The hills above my home&lt;br /&gt;Come slowly into sight,&lt;br /&gt;And I straighten my collar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ishikawa Takuboku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, my friends&lt;br /&gt;All seemed to be&lt;br /&gt;More a success than I.&lt;br /&gt;So I brought flowers&lt;br /&gt;And took them to&lt;br /&gt;My wife, to make her happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ishikawa Takuboku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Star&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How far far away&lt;br /&gt;one star looks, when I’m lying on my back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the same time how near, as if linked&lt;br /&gt;by a golden thread to the corner of my squinting eye,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and in the night, when I gently wake,&lt;br /&gt;how tightly I press against the window-pane, peeping out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abruptly, as if sprouting,&lt;br /&gt;as if waiting to be called, as if welcoming,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;suddenly, a lonely flame flares within my soul&lt;br /&gt;in regrets that gust like the wind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rise in my white night-clothes&lt;br /&gt;and clasp my hands to my heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chong Chi-yong&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sorrow of Parting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the ear of an anchor, a gull croaks.&lt;br /&gt;Suddenly, without a word, the anchor glides down.&lt;br /&gt;Startled, the seagull takes off.&lt;br /&gt;In a moment, the anchor turns pale in the water, sinking.&lt;br /&gt;And what the seagull feels becomes a wild, sad scream&lt;br /&gt;Lost in the wind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maruyama Kaoru&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Night song of a traveler&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cold rain swirls savagely,&lt;br /&gt;The lantern in my head hardly&lt;br /&gt;Pierces the gloom at my feet,&lt;br /&gt;Walking through endless night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why should I be walking?&lt;br /&gt;I have put them aside – engulfing&lt;br /&gt;Bed, warm talk, light.  But&lt;br /&gt;Why should I be walking?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When dawn comes, before I sleep,&lt;br /&gt;Where should I get to?  And, once there,&lt;br /&gt;What should I do?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wet through to the skin –&lt;br /&gt;But, wet, I recall&lt;br /&gt;Only good memories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shall I go home?&lt;br /&gt;Or shall I go down&lt;br /&gt;That street of red lights?&lt;br /&gt;No.  Into the darkness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tachihara Michizo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&amp;mdash;
