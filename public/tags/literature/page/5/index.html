      From The Orient Express
One looks from the train
Almost as one looked as a child. In the sunlight
What I see still seems to me plain,
I am safe; but at evening
As the lands darken, a questioning
Precariousness comes over everything.
From Deutsch Durch Freud
Have you too sometimes, by the fire, at evening,
Wished that you were - whatever you once were?
From A Girl in a Library

      And, certainly, the way to maturity in thinking is a difficult path. Much must be left behind: early dreams, poetic imaginations, cherished legends, favored doctrines, accustomed laws and ritual traditions. Some of them must be restored on a deeper level, some must be given up. Despite this price, maturity can be gained - a manly, self-critical, convincing faith, not produced by reasoning, but reasonable, and at the same time rooted in the message of the divine foolishness, the ultimate source of wisdom.

      &ldquo;I lie in my own bed,&rdquo;
He whispers, &ldquo;dreaming&rdquo;; and he thinks to wake.
The old mistake.
&ndash;From Randall Jarrell, &ldquo;A Field Hospital&rdquo;
We read our mail and counted up our missions-
In bombers named for girls, we burned
The cities we had learned about in school-
Till our lives wore out; our bodies lay among
The people we had killed and never seen.
When we lasted long enough they gave us medals;

      Every summer he&rsquo;s on the prarie harvesting wheat and every winter in the Wisconsin forests chopping cordwood. That&rsquo;s his life.
A life maybe as good as any other.
&ndash;Knut Hamsun, &ldquo;On the Prarie&rdquo; (from Tales of Love and Loss)
The theological dimension is needed both for interpreting and for solving present day problems in human society.

The human being is made for love and cannot live without love.

      From Transit
A woman I have never seen before
Steps from the darkness of her town-house door
At just that crux of time when she is made
So beautiful that she or time must fade.
-Richard Wilbur
From Journey of the Year 1694
I trudged alone far into Yoshino. The mountains truly stretch on and on, and white clouds lie piled on the peaks. A smoky rain buried the valleys, here and there interrupted by the huts of the mountain folk, very small.

      I had a great time in Tokyo, and now I am home - in Muskegon overnight and driving to Chicago first thing tomorrow morning. I&rsquo;ll post a few of the best pictures from the trip over the weekend.
A few of the things I did in Japan:
-Reconnected with the Japanese people with whom I am closest - Ai (a former exchange student in Muskegon) and my former host family. Had many memorable outings with friends of Ai and became close with one in particular, a guitar-playing writer/actor named Okada who, at age 23, has already published two books of poetry in Japan.

      <p>From How It Should Be in Heaven</p>

<p>How it should be in Heaven I know, for I was there.
By its river. Listening to its birds.
In its season: in summer, shortly after sunrise.
…
Peace eternal
Could have no mornings and no evenings,
Such a deficiency speaks against it.
And that’s too hard a nut for a theologian to crack.
&ndash;Czeslaw Milosz
A business that makes nothing but money is a poor kind of business.</p>

      After a quiet and happy week in Michigan, I am now back in Chicago for a week of training and racing with the U of C cross-country team. This will be my fourth and final year as a member of the squad, and I am more excited about the sport and ready to race than I&rsquo;ve been in years. We begin to miss things and feel the pain of losing them before they go, and being a member of an XC team has been a big part of my life for almost eight years.

      The internship is over and I am home in Muskegon, happy to use the weather as an excuse to spend entire days reading in coffeeshops. I am leaving for Japan on September 5th and my Japanese is very rusty, and there is plenty of IR and political theory I would like to cover before school starts in late September. This should be a wonderful week: home, family, friends, books, bowling, Muskegon, running on the lake.

      The (National Assessment of Educational Progress economics exam), taken by a representative sample of twelfth graders at public and private high schools, tested students on micro- and macroeconomic principles and international trade. What, for example, is the effect of breaking down trade barriers between countries? A majority correctly said that goods would become less expensive. They chose this over &ldquo;the quality of goods available would decrease.&rdquo; Maybe John Edwards should hire more teenagers for his Presidential campaign.
