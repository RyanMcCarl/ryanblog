<p>In you, as in me, there is a hidden certainty

And be real, strong, free from what restrained you.</p>

<p>From Notes
He felt thankful, so he couldn&rsquo;t not believe in God.
From A Poetic State
Every minute the spectacle of the world astonishes me; it is so comic that I cannot understand how literature could expect to cope with it.</p>

The dairy man had a Ph.D. in mathematics, and he must have had some training in philosophy. He liked what he was doing and he didn&rsquo;t want to be somewhere else - one of the very few contented people I met in my whole journey.

      For whom, he thought, that splendor? For me alone?
Yet it will be here long after I perish.
-Czeslaw Milosz, from &ldquo;Study of Loneliness&rdquo;
Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for thereby some have entertained angels unawares. Remember those who are in prison, as though in prison with them; and those who are ill-treated, since you are also in the body.
-Hebrews 13:1-3
The behavior of individual consumers and producers in the rational pursuit of their objectives is governed by the principle of marginal utility, or marginality.

      You will hear thunder and remember me,
And think: she wanted storms. The rim
Of the sky will be the colour of hard crimson,
And your heart, as it was then, will be on fire.
That day in Moscow, it will all come true,
When, for the last time, I take my leave,
And hasten to the heights I have longed for,
Leaving my shadow still to be with you.

      The feelings of that night were so near that I could reach out and touch them with my hand. I had the sense of coming home to myself, and of having found out what a little circle man&rsquo;s experience is.

It came over me, as it had never done before, the relation between girls like those and the poetry of Virgil. If there were no girls like them in the world, there would be no poetry.

      Count it all joy, my brethren, when you meet various trials, for you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness. And let steadfastness have its full effect, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking nothing.
-James 1:2-4
But be doers of the world, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves. For if any one is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who observes his natural face in a mirror: for he observes himself and goes away and at once forgets what he was like.

      Happy Independence Day! I&rsquo;ll be spending a lazy Fourth revelling in freedom from work, sitting on the back porch with my roommates, and reading like crazy.
Just discovered Anna Akhmatova, a Russian poet who wrote and published under the specter of Soviet communism and Stalinism; her husband of eleven years was shot in 1921 as a &ldquo;counter-revolutionary,&rdquo; her son and lover were arrested and sent to labor camps, and she herself was regularly persecuted and followed by the secret police.

      Overland to the Islands
Let&rsquo;s go - much as that dog goes,
intently haphazard. The
Mexican light on a day that
&lsquo;smells like autumn in Connecticut&rsquo;
makes iris ripples on his
black gleaming fur - and that too
is as one would desire - a radiance
consorting with the dance.
Under his feet
rocks and mud, his imagination, sniffing,
engaged in its perceptions - dancing
edgeways, there&rsquo;s nothing
the dog disdains on his way,

      Even as a boy he used to feel, when he saw her coming with her free step, her upright head and calm shoulders, that she looked as if she had walked straight out of the morning itself.

&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather have had your freedom than my land.&rdquo;
Carl shook his head mournfully. &ldquo;Freedom so often means that one isn&rsquo;t needed anywhere. Here you are an individual, you have a background of your own, you would be missed.
