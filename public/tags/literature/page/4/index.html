Akhmatova, Selected Poems
Bonhoeffer, Letters and Papers From Prison
Cumings, Korea’s Place in the Sun
de Bary, Sources of Japanese Tradition
Frye, The Educated Imagination

      He wanders eastward, toward the sun, he comes to a mountain. A voice calls: are you near a mountain? Yes, he answers, I&rsquo;m standing near a mountain. Then the voice says: That mountain you are standing near is my foot; I am lying bound in the uttermost part of the earth, come set me free!
&hellip;
Later, when he came to think about it, he acknowledged that those hours had had a significance for him that no one could realize, and if it was true - as had just been said - that at times his writing sparkled, then it was his memories of that time that had kindled the spark; it was a reflection of the happiness his two playmates had bestowed on him in his childhood.

      I don’t switch on the ceiling light at once but leave the room in twilight so the yellow flames in the stove flicker brightly over the floor and walls. The sight of them slows my breathing down and makes me calm as it must have done for men through thousands of years: let the wolves howl, here by the fire it’s safe.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      The following editorial was published in this morning&rsquo;s Philadelphia Inquirer:
I was thrilled to learn that The Golden Compass, the first book in Philip Pullman&rsquo;s &ldquo;His Dark Materials&rdquo; trilogy, was going to be released as a movie on Friday. I read the trilogy first in middle school and again in high school, and it was my favorite story for a long time. It is filled with imagination and erudition, and it is a significant cut above the vast majority of works aimed at young adults.

      The fact that an intellectual formula never has been and never will be devised which could embrace and express the manifest possibilities of life must lead to the inhibition or exclusion of other activities and ways of living that are just as important. &hellip;Doubtless there are exceptional people who are able to sacrifice their entire life to a particular formula, but for most of us such exclusiveness is impossible in the long run.

      From Fables about Error
What is as wrong as the uninstructed heart?
Left to its ends, it clutches things and creatures
That can&rsquo;t be held, or held, will slip their natures;
It lives to hoard or to protect a hoard.
To school, to school! Teach the poor organ skill
That all its ignorant, nervous will
Does not unpage us like old calendars.
A life should be all gathering and art.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      This was one of the best weekends of my life. It was my last team trip as a member of a collegiate cross-country squad, and memories were made. We traveled to beautiful, spacious Oshkosh, WI for the Midwest Regional meet. Shortly before the starting gun, huddling with the team, doing stride-outs, and giving high-fives, I realized that I was doing all of these things for the last time, and in a moment of clarity I understood how much cross-country has meant to me for the past 8 years.

      Original Aversions
In all respects unready for a fall
They fell, our first progenitors, and these
Two traumas still disturb us most of all:
High places and our own unreadiness.
Towers or wells unfoot us in our dreams
Repeatedly. Old-fashioned people still
Believe that nothing saves them but their screams
And that an unawakened fall would kill.
Anticipation cannot really ease
The other trouble; waiting for the day
When such and such will happen or will pass,

      We keep the wall between us as we go.
To each the boulders that have fallen to each.
Robert Frost
&ndash;From &ldquo;Mending Wall&rdquo;
World peace cannot be safeguarded without the making of creative efforts proportionate to the dangers which threaten it.
Robert Schumann
&ndash;&ldquo;The Schumann Declaration&rdquo;
I asked her, urgently, if she could see my face, and she said: &ldquo;See it?&rdquo; And, smiling: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s reflected in my eyes, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;

      <p>From Ten-Day Leave
Oh, identity is a traveling-piece with some,
But here is what calls me, here what I call home.</p>

<p>A Major Work
Poems are hard to read
Pictures are hard to see
Music is hard to hear
And people are hard to love.
But whether from brute need
Or divine energy
At last mind eye and ear
And the great sloth heart will move.
From June: Dutch Harbor</p>
