      Among the many definitions of Communism, perhaps one would be the most apt: enemy of orchards. For the disappearance of villages and the remodeling of the terrain necessitated cutting down the orchards once surrounding every house and hut. The idea of collective farming - grain factories instead of little peasant lots - was rational, but with a vengeance, and a similar vengeance lurking in practically every project of the planned economy brought about the downfall of the Soviet system.

      Goethe comments that the Church erred in closing the canon of scripture, as God&rsquo;s creative work still continues, notably in the activity of great spirits like Mozart, Raphael, and Shakespeare, &ldquo;who can draw their lesser contemporaries higher.&rdquo;

For the first time in history, authors of highly successful works can hope to have them translated into twenty or thirty languages within a few years of publication, and foreign countries may even provide the primary readership for writers who have small audiences at home or who are censored by their governments.

      Even in mundane situations, the individual must act in order to discover what he is and he must act in order to continue experiencing aspects of himself which he values and enjoys. If he thinks of himself as a businessman, a parent, an athlete, an intellectual, he must engage in behavior appropriate to this self-image. If he does not, he must redefine himself, or he will be left feeling anxious and needful.

      He who refuses to embrace a unique opportunity loses the prize as surely as if he tried and failed.
&hellip;
Our errors are surely not such awfully solemn things. In a world where we are so certain to incur them in spite of all our caution, a certain lightness of heart seems healthier than this excessive nervousness on their behalf.
&hellip;
Let us give the name hypothesis to anything that may be proposed to our belief; and just as the electricians speak of live and dead wires, let us speak of any hypothesis as either live or dead.

      It is impossible to think - seriously - with words like Classicism, Romanticism, Humanism, Realism. &hellip;One does not get drunk nor does one quench one&rsquo;s thirst with bottle labels.
-Paul Valery, quoted in C. Milosz, The History of Polish Poetry
Beauty is momentary in the mind -
The fitful tracing of a portal;
But in the flesh it is immortal.
Wallace Stevens
&ndash;&ldquo;Peter Quince at the Clavier&rdquo;
At no moment during my work did I feel boredom; indeed, I was playing more than toiling, and several passages preserve, I hope, a trace of my smile.

      Had Pyrrhus not fallen by a beldham&rsquo;s hand in Argos or Julius Caesar not been knifed to death? They are not to be thought away. Time has branded them and fettered they are lodged in the room of the infinite possibilities they have ousted. But can those have been possible seeing that they never were? Or was that only possible which came to pass? Weave, weaver of the wind.

      The main feature of the Kingston Plains was the thousands of acres of white pine stumps, some of them very large, which had been cut at waist or chest height probably during the winter when it was easier to skid the trees out on snow-covered trails which they dampened to form ice so that the draft horse-drawn log sleighs could be more easily pulled. &hellip;I swiveled around until I had completed a 360-degree view, suppressing any anger I felt over the idea that they might have left a few trees for those in the future to look at.

      He wanders eastward, toward the sun, he comes to a mountain. A voice calls: are you near a mountain? Yes, he answers, I&rsquo;m standing near a mountain. Then the voice says: That mountain you are standing near is my foot; I am lying bound in the uttermost part of the earth, come set me free!
&hellip;
Later, when he came to think about it, he acknowledged that those hours had had a significance for him that no one could realize, and if it was true - as had just been said - that at times his writing sparkled, then it was his memories of that time that had kindled the spark; it was a reflection of the happiness his two playmates had bestowed on him in his childhood.

      The following editorial was published in this morning&rsquo;s Philadelphia Inquirer:
I was thrilled to learn that The Golden Compass, the first book in Philip Pullman&rsquo;s &ldquo;His Dark Materials&rdquo; trilogy, was going to be released as a movie on Friday. I read the trilogy first in middle school and again in high school, and it was my favorite story for a long time. It is filled with imagination and erudition, and it is a significant cut above the vast majority of works aimed at young adults.

      His lack of all thought by which to weigh the danger against the attractiveness of the bait, and of all volition to remain hungry a little while longer, is the direct measure of his lowness in the mental scale.
William James
&ndash;The Principles of Psychology
But whether small or great, and no matter what the stage or grade of life, the call (to adventure) rings up the curtain, always, on a mystery of transfiguration - a rite, or moment, of spiritual passage, which, when complete, amounts to a dying and a birth.
