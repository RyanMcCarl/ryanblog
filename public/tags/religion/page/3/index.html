      From Brad Leithauser&rsquo;s introduction to Halldor Laxness&rsquo; novel Independent People: &ldquo;There are good books and there are great books and there may be a book that is something still more: it is the book of your life. &hellip;One looks differently on the book of genius that, even in a long bookworm&rsquo;s life, one might not have stumbled upon.&rdquo;
Excerpts:
But higher than all dealers and societies stand the dreams of the heart, especially in the autumn when dusk is falling and the clouds of the world are full of marvellous pictures&hellip;.

      Watch how the cloud sings
All you wanted to say or find.
Yehuda Amichai
&ndash;&ldquo;Let the Coin Decide&rdquo;
And the migration of my parents
Has not subsided in me. My blood goes on sloshing
Between my ribs, long after the vessel has come to rest.
And the migration of my parents has not subsided in me.
Winds of long time over stones. Earth
Forgets the steps of those who trod her.

      It was good to finally know that the spirit was everywhere rather than a separate thing.
&hellip;
Clare fed our leftover sandwiches to a stray mutt, who didn&rsquo;t chew the proper thirty-two times.
&hellip;
All of my jobs had kept me grounded in actual life whereas simply sitting in my room with my studies tended to make me unstable.
&hellip;
In New York City the endless blocks of huge buildings say to us, I&rsquo;m serious and within me serious people are doing serious things even though five thousand people in a building might only be playing with the market edge.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      Despite insistent demands by minority groups, principally Catholics, but including Jews, Presbyterians, Baptists, and Methodists, for equal funding for their free schools, the common school movement soon achieved a monopoly of public funding. Many states even adopted constitutional provisions barring state funding of religious schools, and a federal constitutional amendment to that effect was narrowly defeated in Congress. The opposition to particularistic private schools grew to the extent that, in the early twentieth century, some states passed laws forbidding the education of children in languages other than English and banning private schools altogether.

      Among the many definitions of Communism, perhaps one would be the most apt: enemy of orchards. For the disappearance of villages and the remodeling of the terrain necessitated cutting down the orchards once surrounding every house and hut. The idea of collective farming - grain factories instead of little peasant lots - was rational, but with a vengeance, and a similar vengeance lurking in practically every project of the planned economy brought about the downfall of the Soviet system.

      Goethe comments that the Church erred in closing the canon of scripture, as God&rsquo;s creative work still continues, notably in the activity of great spirits like Mozart, Raphael, and Shakespeare, &ldquo;who can draw their lesser contemporaries higher.&rdquo;

For the first time in history, authors of highly successful works can hope to have them translated into twenty or thirty languages within a few years of publication, and foreign countries may even provide the primary readership for writers who have small audiences at home or who are censored by their governments.

      Even in mundane situations, the individual must act in order to discover what he is and he must act in order to continue experiencing aspects of himself which he values and enjoys. If he thinks of himself as a businessman, a parent, an athlete, an intellectual, he must engage in behavior appropriate to this self-image. If he does not, he must redefine himself, or he will be left feeling anxious and needful.

      He who refuses to embrace a unique opportunity loses the prize as surely as if he tried and failed.
&hellip;
Our errors are surely not such awfully solemn things. In a world where we are so certain to incur them in spite of all our caution, a certain lightness of heart seems healthier than this excessive nervousness on their behalf.
&hellip;
Let us give the name hypothesis to anything that may be proposed to our belief; and just as the electricians speak of live and dead wires, let us speak of any hypothesis as either live or dead.

      It is impossible to think - seriously - with words like Classicism, Romanticism, Humanism, Realism. &hellip;One does not get drunk nor does one quench one&rsquo;s thirst with bottle labels.
-Paul Valery, quoted in C. Milosz, The History of Polish Poetry
Beauty is momentary in the mind -
The fitful tracing of a portal;
But in the flesh it is immortal.
Wallace Stevens
&ndash;&ldquo;Peter Quince at the Clavier&rdquo;
At no moment during my work did I feel boredom; indeed, I was playing more than toiling, and several passages preserve, I hope, a trace of my smile.

      Had Pyrrhus not fallen by a beldham&rsquo;s hand in Argos or Julius Caesar not been knifed to death? They are not to be thought away. Time has branded them and fettered they are lodged in the room of the infinite possibilities they have ousted. But can those have been possible seeing that they never were? Or was that only possible which came to pass? Weave, weaver of the wind.
