      <p>He read no books, but his thoughts were often with God; it was natural, coming of simplicity and awe. The stars in the sky, the wind in the trees, the solitude and the wide-spreading snow, the might of earth and over earth filled him many times a day with a deep earnestness.

      Never does one do evil so fully and so gaily as when one does it as a matter of conscience.
&ndash;Pensee 895
What a man&rsquo;s virtue is capable of is not to be measured by his exceptional efforts, but by his daily life.
&ndash;Pensee 352
He must have movements of humiliation, not as a consequence of his nature, but of penitence; not as a constant attitude, but to permit him to rise to elevation.

      One of the most important - and most neglected - elements in the beginnings of the interior life is the ability to respond to reality, to see the value and beauty in ordinary things, to come alive to the splendor that is all around us in the creatures of God. We do not see these things because we have withdrawn from them. &ndash;Thomas Merton, No Man is an Island
There&rsquo;s absolutely nothing to take the place of a good man.

      Living is more than submission: it is creation. To live is to create one&rsquo;s own world as a scene of personal happiness.
-Thomas Merton, &ldquo;The Street is For Celebration&rdquo;
Celebration is the beginning of confidence, therefore of power.
-Thomas Merton, &ldquo;The Street is For Celebration&rdquo;
The next passage in my journey is a love affair. I am in love with Montana. For other states I have admiration, respect, recognition, even some affection, but with Montana it is love, and it&rsquo;s difficult to analyze love when you&rsquo;re in it.

      <p>From An Appeal</p>

<p>In you, as in me, there is a hidden certainty
That soon you will rise, in undiminished light,
And be real, strong, free from what restrained you.</p>

<p>From Notes
He felt thankful, so he couldn&rsquo;t not believe in God.
From A Poetic State
Every minute the spectacle of the world astonishes me; it is so comic that I cannot understand how literature could expect to cope with it.</p>

      For whom, he thought, that splendor? For me alone?
Yet it will be here long after I perish.
-Czeslaw Milosz, from &ldquo;Study of Loneliness&rdquo;
Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for thereby some have entertained angels unawares. Remember those who are in prison, as though in prison with them; and those who are ill-treated, since you are also in the body.
-Hebrews 13:1-3
The behavior of individual consumers and producers in the rational pursuit of their objectives is governed by the principle of marginal utility, or marginality.

      The feelings of that night were so near that I could reach out and touch them with my hand. I had the sense of coming home to myself, and of having found out what a little circle man&rsquo;s experience is.

It came over me, as it had never done before, the relation between girls like those and the poetry of Virgil. If there were no girls like them in the world, there would be no poetry.

      Count it all joy, my brethren, when you meet various trials, for you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness. And let steadfastness have its full effect, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking nothing.
-James 1:2-4
But be doers of the world, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves. For if any one is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who observes his natural face in a mirror: for he observes himself and goes away and at once forgets what he was like.

      When You Are Old
When you are old and grey and full of sleep,
And nodding by the fire, take down this book,
And slowly read, and dream of the soft look
Your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;
How many loved your moments of glad grace,
And loved your beauty with love false or true,
But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,
And loved the sorrows of your changing face;

      If the stars should appear one night in a thousand years, how would men believe and adore, and preserve for many generations the remembrance of the city of God which had been shown! But every night come out these envoys of beauty, and light the universe with their admonishing smile.
…
Broad moon shall be my England of the senses and the understanding; the night shall be my Germany of mystic philosophy and dreams.
