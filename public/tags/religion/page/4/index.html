      The main feature of the Kingston Plains was the thousands of acres of white pine stumps, some of them very large, which had been cut at waist or chest height probably during the winter when it was easier to skid the trees out on snow-covered trails which they dampened to form ice so that the draft horse-drawn log sleighs could be more easily pulled. &hellip;I swiveled around until I had completed a 360-degree view, suppressing any anger I felt over the idea that they might have left a few trees for those in the future to look at.

      He wanders eastward, toward the sun, he comes to a mountain. A voice calls: are you near a mountain? Yes, he answers, I&rsquo;m standing near a mountain. Then the voice says: That mountain you are standing near is my foot; I am lying bound in the uttermost part of the earth, come set me free!
&hellip;
Later, when he came to think about it, he acknowledged that those hours had had a significance for him that no one could realize, and if it was true - as had just been said - that at times his writing sparkled, then it was his memories of that time that had kindled the spark; it was a reflection of the happiness his two playmates had bestowed on him in his childhood.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      The following editorial was published in this morning&rsquo;s Philadelphia Inquirer:
I was thrilled to learn that The Golden Compass, the first book in Philip Pullman&rsquo;s &ldquo;His Dark Materials&rdquo; trilogy, was going to be released as a movie on Friday. I read the trilogy first in middle school and again in high school, and it was my favorite story for a long time. It is filled with imagination and erudition, and it is a significant cut above the vast majority of works aimed at young adults.

      His lack of all thought by which to weigh the danger against the attractiveness of the bait, and of all volition to remain hungry a little while longer, is the direct measure of his lowness in the mental scale.
William James
&ndash;The Principles of Psychology
But whether small or great, and no matter what the stage or grade of life, the call (to adventure) rings up the curtain, always, on a mystery of transfiguration - a rite, or moment, of spiritual passage, which, when complete, amounts to a dying and a birth.

      The fact that an intellectual formula never has been and never will be devised which could embrace and express the manifest possibilities of life must lead to the inhibition or exclusion of other activities and ways of living that are just as important. &hellip;Doubtless there are exceptional people who are able to sacrifice their entire life to a particular formula, but for most of us such exclusiveness is impossible in the long run.

      Original Aversions
In all respects unready for a fall
They fell, our first progenitors, and these
Two traumas still disturb us most of all:
High places and our own unreadiness.
Towers or wells unfoot us in our dreams
Repeatedly. Old-fashioned people still
Believe that nothing saves them but their screams
And that an unawakened fall would kill.
Anticipation cannot really ease
The other trouble; waiting for the day
When such and such will happen or will pass,

      Every summer he&rsquo;s on the prarie harvesting wheat and every winter in the Wisconsin forests chopping cordwood. That&rsquo;s his life.
A life maybe as good as any other.
&ndash;Knut Hamsun, &ldquo;On the Prarie&rdquo; (from Tales of Love and Loss)
The theological dimension is needed both for interpreting and for solving present day problems in human society.
&ndash;Pope John Paul II, Centesimus Annus
The human being is made for love and cannot live without love.

      -Today&rsquo;s Maroon column: &ldquo;Certainty is a luxury none of us has.&rdquo; Religious fundamentalists and secular fundamentalists are all-too-alike in their belief that they, and only they, have answers to the biggest questions in the human dialogue. What unites us all is doubt and searching. Read the article here.
-Must-read: &ldquo;Principal of Arabic School Says She was Forced Out.&rdquo; This is what racist, nativist hysteria looks like.
-From an Economist article on the new Fox Business Channel: Mr Murdoch apparently wants his channel to be more “pro-capitalism” than CNBC—which is hardly a pinko outfit—and, sure enough, there was soon a discussion about the pharmaceutical industry entitled &ldquo;Capitalism cures cancer&rdquo;, which—let’s be “fair and balanced”, as the Fox News slogan puts it—it does.

      As we would expect, during most wars consumer spending is deliberately held back by heavy taxes to make room for swelling military expenditure. During World War II, for example, consumption was squeezed back by heavy taxes to barely more than half of GDP. …During the Vietnam War military expenses for that conflict were not compensated by taxes to roll back consumption and the excess demand for goods and services ignited a subsequent inflation.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      Not many years ago great offence was given by an eminent writer who remarked that the time had come when the history of Christianity should be treated in a truly historical spirit, in the same spirit in which we treat the history of other religions, such as Brahmanism, Buddhism, or Mohammedanism. And yet what can be truer? He must be a man of little faith, who would fear to subject his own religion to the same critical tests to which the historian subjects all other religions.
