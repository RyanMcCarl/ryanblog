      The fact that an intellectual formula never has been and never will be devised which could embrace and express the manifest possibilities of life must lead to the inhibition or exclusion of other activities and ways of living that are just as important. &hellip;Doubtless there are exceptional people who are able to sacrifice their entire life to a particular formula, but for most of us such exclusiveness is impossible in the long run.

      Original Aversions
In all respects unready for a fall
They fell, our first progenitors, and these
Two traumas still disturb us most of all:
High places and our own unreadiness.
Towers or wells unfoot us in our dreams
Repeatedly. Old-fashioned people still
Believe that nothing saves them but their screams
And that an unawakened fall would kill.
Anticipation cannot really ease
The other trouble; waiting for the day
When such and such will happen or will pass,

      Every summer he&rsquo;s on the prarie harvesting wheat and every winter in the Wisconsin forests chopping cordwood. That&rsquo;s his life.
A life maybe as good as any other.
&ndash;Knut Hamsun, &ldquo;On the Prarie&rdquo; (from Tales of Love and Loss)
The theological dimension is needed both for interpreting and for solving present day problems in human society.

The human being is made for love and cannot live without love.

      -Today&rsquo;s Maroon column: &ldquo;Certainty is a luxury none of us has.&rdquo; Religious fundamentalists and secular fundamentalists are all-too-alike in their belief that they, and only they, have answers to the biggest questions in the human dialogue. What unites us all is doubt and searching. Read the article here.
-Must-read: &ldquo;Principal of Arabic School Says She was Forced Out.&rdquo; This is what racist, nativist hysteria looks like.
-From an Economist article on the new Fox Business Channel: Mr Murdoch apparently wants his channel to be more “pro-capitalism” than CNBC—which is hardly a pinko outfit—and, sure enough, there was soon a discussion about the pharmaceutical industry entitled &ldquo;Capitalism cures cancer&rdquo;, which—let’s be “fair and balanced”, as the Fox News slogan puts it—it does.

      As we would expect, during most wars consumer spending is deliberately held back by heavy taxes to make room for swelling military expenditure. During World War II, for example, consumption was squeezed back by heavy taxes to barely more than half of GDP. …During the Vietnam War military expenses for that conflict were not compensated by taxes to roll back consumption and the excess demand for goods and services ignited a subsequent inflation.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      Not many years ago great offence was given by an eminent writer who remarked that the time had come when the history of Christianity should be treated in a truly historical spirit, in the same spirit in which we treat the history of other religions, such as Brahmanism, Buddhism, or Mohammedanism. And yet what can be truer? He must be a man of little faith, who would fear to subject his own religion to the same critical tests to which the historian subjects all other religions.

      <p>He read no books, but his thoughts were often with God; it was natural, coming of simplicity and awe. The stars in the sky, the wind in the trees, the solitude and the wide-spreading snow, the might of earth and over earth filled him many times a day with a deep earnestness.

      Never does one do evil so fully and so gaily as when one does it as a matter of conscience.
&ndash;Pensee 895
What a man&rsquo;s virtue is capable of is not to be measured by his exceptional efforts, but by his daily life.
&ndash;Pensee 352
He must have movements of humiliation, not as a consequence of his nature, but of penitence; not as a constant attitude, but to permit him to rise to elevation.

      One of the most important - and most neglected - elements in the beginnings of the interior life is the ability to respond to reality, to see the value and beauty in ordinary things, to come alive to the splendor that is all around us in the creatures of God. We do not see these things because we have withdrawn from them. &ndash;Thomas Merton, No Man is an Island

      Living is more than submission: it is creation. To live is to create one&rsquo;s own world as a scene of personal happiness.
-Thomas Merton, &ldquo;The Street is For Celebration&rdquo;
Celebration is the beginning of confidence, therefore of power.
-Thomas Merton, &ldquo;The Street is For Celebration&rdquo;
The next passage in my journey is a love affair. I am in love with Montana. For other states I have admiration, respect, recognition, even some affection, but with Montana it is love, and it&rsquo;s difficult to analyze love when you&rsquo;re in it.
