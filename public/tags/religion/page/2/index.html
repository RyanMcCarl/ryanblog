      Nick&rsquo;s heart tightened as the trout moved. He felt all the old feeling.
&hellip;
His muscles ached and the day was hot, but Nick felt happy. He had left everything behind, the need for thinking, the need to write, other needs. It was all back of him. From the time he had gotten down off the train and the baggage man had thrown his pack out of the open car door things had been different.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      I recently picked up Wendy Doniger&rsquo;s new book The Hindus: An Alternative History. Doniger, the Mircea Eliade Distinguished Service Professor of Religions at the University of Chicago Divinity School and America&rsquo;s foremost scholar of Hinduism, set out to challenge many prevailing notions of Hinduism and argue for a more inclusive, broad view of the tradition, a view that recognizes the diversity of folk religions in the Hindu world as well as the contributions of women, Muslims, and people of the lower castes to the Hindu tradition.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      Faith does not insulate us from the challenges of life; rather, it intensifies our desire to help solve them&hellip;. From the resources of our faith we wish to provide hope and strength to all who seek a world free of the nuclear threat. Hope sustains one&rsquo;s capacity to live with danger without being overwhelmed by it; hope is the will to struggle against obstacles even when they appear insuperable. Ultimately our hope rests in the God who gave us life, sustains the world by his power and has called us to revere the lives of every person and all peoples.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      Mark C. Taylor, contrarian philosopher and chair of Columbia University&rsquo;s Department of Religion, caused a firestorm in the academic community with his op-ed, &ldquo;End the University as We Know It,&rdquo; in yesterday&rsquo;s New York Times. The op-ed remains at the top of the NYT&rsquo;s most-emailed list.
There are few better places to have a debate about the philosophy of education than the University of Chicago, where the Core Curriculum and the school&rsquo;s historical emphasis on liberal education and distaste for vocational education permeates everything.

      Let the most absent-minded of men be plunged in his deepest reveries - stand that man on his legs, set his feet a-going, and he will infallibly lead you to water, if water there be in all that region. &hellip;Yes, as every one knows, meditation and water are wedded for ever.&hellip;What of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get a broom and sweep down the decks?

      An article I wrote about my incredible high school cross country coach, John Swinburne, was published today in the Muskegon Chronicle and on MLive.com. Check it out here.
Swinburne has worked formally and informally in education as a coach, teacher, athletic director, driver&rsquo;s ed instructor, youth group leader, and mentor to thousands of students in the Muskegon, MI area for four decades. He is a truly great man who has changed many lives, including mine, through his coaching.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      I recently finished Jim Harrison&rsquo;s latest novel, The English Major. Harrison, a native of my home state of Michigan, is my favorite contemporary author, and The English Major is the best &rdquo;fun read&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve had in a long time. In trademark Harrison style, it is both hilarious and poignant, and it contains some great passages. Excerpts below.
&hellip;I tried to dismiss a pinprick of homesickness beneath my breastbone but then thought that homesickness like marital love was mostly a habit.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      I recently discovered the work of Erazim Kohak, a Czech philosopher and Professor Emeritus at Boston University who has written extensively on environmental ethics. I am 30 pages into Kohak&rsquo;s The Embers and the Stars: A Philosophical Inquiry into the Moral Sense of Nature, and it is incredible so far. A few excerpts below, with more to come.
Reflection and speculation remain no more than cunningly devised fables if they are not grounded in what, paraphrasing Calvin Schrag, we could call the prephilosophical and prescientific matrix of self-understanding and world-comprehension.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      A great American public intellectual has died: Richard John Neuhaus, the founding editor of First Things. Neuhaus was a liberal Lutheran minister active in the Civil Rights and antiwar movements of the 1960s who converted to Roman Catholicism and became a staunch, vocal social conservative. I disagreed with him about most things, but I have the highest respect for his talents as a writer, and First Things is the best conservative magazine available on the intersection of religion and culture.

      Happy New Year! At the end of each of the past three years, I&rsquo;ve written a post listing the best books I&rsquo;ve read over the course of the year in order to bring these books to the attention of others. My lists from 2007 and 2006 are available here and here.
As usual, I&rsquo;ve put the titles of the five books most important to me this year in bold, and I&rsquo;ve linked each book to its Amazon.
