      Faith does not insulate us from the challenges of life; rather, it intensifies our desire to help solve them&hellip;. From the resources of our faith we wish to provide hope and strength to all who seek a world free of the nuclear threat. Hope sustains one&rsquo;s capacity to live with danger without being overwhelmed by it; hope is the will to struggle against obstacles even when they appear insuperable. Ultimately our hope rests in the God who gave us life, sustains the world by his power and has called us to revere the lives of every person and all peoples.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      Mark C. Taylor, contrarian philosopher and chair of Columbia University&rsquo;s Department of Religion, caused a firestorm in the academic community with his op-ed, &ldquo;End the University as We Know It,&rdquo; in yesterday&rsquo;s New York Times. The op-ed remains at the top of the NYT&rsquo;s most-emailed list.
There are few better places to have a debate about the philosophy of education than the University of Chicago, where the Core Curriculum and the school&rsquo;s historical emphasis on liberal education and distaste for vocational education permeates everything.

      Let the most absent-minded of men be plunged in his deepest reveries - stand that man on his legs, set his feet a-going, and he will infallibly lead you to water, if water there be in all that region. &hellip;Yes, as every one knows, meditation and water are wedded for ever.&hellip;What of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get a broom and sweep down the decks?

    <div class="article-style">
      
      I recently finished Jim Harrison&rsquo;s latest novel, The English Major. Harrison, a native of my home state of Michigan, is my favorite contemporary author, and The English Major is the bestÂ &rdquo;fun read&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve had in a long time. In trademark Harrison style, it is both hilarious and poignant, and it contains some great passages. Excerpts below.
&hellip;I tried to dismiss a pinprick of homesickness beneath my breastbone but then thought that homesickness like marital love was mostly a habit.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      I recently discovered the work of Erazim Kohak, a Czech philosopher and Professor Emeritus at Boston University who has written extensively on environmental ethics. I am 30 pages into Kohak&rsquo;s The Embers and the Stars: A Philosophical Inquiry into the Moral Sense of Nature, and it is incredible so far. A few excerpts below, with more to come.
Reflection and speculation remain no more than cunningly devised fables if they are not grounded in what, paraphrasing Calvin Schrag, we could call the prephilosophical and prescientific matrix of self-understanding and world-comprehension.

      Happy New Year! At the end of each of the past three years, I&rsquo;ve written a post listing the best books I&rsquo;ve read over the course of the year in order to bring these books to the attention of others. My lists from 2007 and 2006 are available here and here.
As usual, I&rsquo;ve put the titles of the five books most important to me this year in bold, and I&rsquo;ve linked each book to its Amazon.

      From Brad Leithauser&rsquo;s introduction to Halldor Laxness&rsquo; novel Independent People: &ldquo;There are good books and there are great books and there may be a book that is something still more: it is the book of your life. &hellip;One looks differently on the book of genius that, even in a long bookworm&rsquo;s life, one might not have stumbled upon.&rdquo;
Excerpts:
But higher than all dealers and societies stand the dreams of the heart, especially in the autumn when dusk is falling and the clouds of the world are full of marvellous pictures&hellip;.

And the migration of my parents
Has not subsided in me. My blood goes on sloshing
Between my ribs, long after the vessel has come to rest.
And the migration of my parents has not subsided in me.
Winds of long time over stones. Earth
Forgets the steps of those who trod her.

      It was good to finally know that the spirit was everywhere rather than a separate thing.

Clare fed our leftover sandwiches to a stray mutt, who didn&rsquo;t chew the proper thirty-two times.
&hellip;
All of my jobs had kept me grounded in actual life whereas simply sitting in my room with my studies tended to make me unstable.
&hellip;
In New York City the endless blocks of huge buildings say to us, I&rsquo;m serious and within me serious people are doing serious things even though five thousand people in a building might only be playing with the market edge.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      Despite insistent demands by minority groups, principally Catholics, but including Jews, Presbyterians, Baptists, and Methodists, for equal funding for their free schools, the common school movement soon achieved a monopoly of public funding. Many states even adopted constitutional provisions barring state funding of religious schools, and a federal constitutional amendment to that effect was narrowly defeated in Congress. The opposition to particularistic private schools grew to the extent that, in the early twentieth century, some states passed laws forbidding the education of children in languages other than English and banning private schools altogether.
