      <p>I appeared on Russia Today (RT) yesterday to discuss the U.S./NATO intervention in Libya as well as the situation in Syria - feel free to check it out if you are interested:</p>

<p>My related article, &ldquo;Rolling the Dice in Libya,&rdquo; appeared on Antiwar.com yesterday.
Another, unrelated op-ed of mine appeared yesterday as well in the Michigan Education Report: &ldquo;National standards will stifle innovation.&rdquo; In it, I argue that &ldquo;strict standards risk forcing students and teachers alike into a curricular straitjacket, alienating creative teachers and sapping the motivation of students.</p>

How to Think About Politics
Ryan McCarl
First, question everything, beginning with the political ideas you inherited from your parents, family, community, church, and school.

      A few of my recent posts at Wide Awake Minds, in case you missed them:
-A few of the things you can do in a great university, in which I argue that if students want to make the most of their school years in general and their college years in particular, they must take ownership of their education and elect to do what is difficult. I propose a few of the ways in which college students can do so.

      No more than three weeks after making my final decision to move to Ann Arbor to pursue an M.A. in Education at the University of Michigan and become a high school history teacher, it is happening: my furniture is being sold or moved, my possessions are being sorted into boxes. Yesterday was my last day at the bookstore I&rsquo;ve worked at as a manager since August. On Friday I&rsquo;ll be on the road to Muskegon with a stuffed car and another empty apartment behind me, and on Sunday I&rsquo;ll be in Ann Arbor to begin the next stage of my life.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      I&rsquo;m excited to report that I have decided to enter the University of Michigan School of Education&rsquo;s Secondary MAC (MA in Education with Secondary Certification) program in mid-June. The program is 12 months long and includes over 1,000 hours of classroom experience as a student teacher and substitute teacher, resulting in full certification.
I look forward to finding unique ways to show my students the importance of learning and reading as well as the value of informed engagement with current events and politics.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      Mark C. Taylor, contrarian philosopher and chair of Columbia University&rsquo;s Department of Religion, caused a firestorm in the academic community with his op-ed, &ldquo;End the University as We Know It,&rdquo; in yesterday&rsquo;s New York Times. The op-ed remains at the top of the NYT&rsquo;s most-emailed list.
There are few better places to have a debate about the philosophy of education than the University of Chicago, where the Core Curriculum and the school&rsquo;s historical emphasis on liberal education and distaste for vocational education permeates everything.

      An article I wrote about my incredible high school cross country coach, John Swinburne, was published today in the Muskegon Chronicle and on MLive.com. Check it out here.
Swinburne has worked formally and informally in education as a coach, teacher, athletic director, driver&rsquo;s ed instructor, youth group leader, and mentor to thousands of students in the Muskegon, MI area for four decades. He is a truly great man who has changed many lives, including mine, through his coaching.

      Happy New Year! At the end of each of the past three years, I&rsquo;ve written a post listing the best books I&rsquo;ve read over the course of the year in order to bring these books to the attention of others. My lists from 2007 and 2006 are available here and here.
As usual, I&rsquo;ve put the titles of the five books most important to me this year in bold, and I&rsquo;ve linked each book to its Amazon.

      Despite insistent demands by minority groups, principally Catholics, but including Jews, Presbyterians, Baptists, and Methodists, for equal funding for their free schools, the common school movement soon achieved a monopoly of public funding. Many states even adopted constitutional provisions barring state funding of religious schools, and a federal constitutional amendment to that effect was narrowly defeated in Congress. The opposition to particularistic private schools grew to the extent that, in the early twentieth century, some states passed laws forbidding the education of children in languages other than English and banning private schools altogether.
