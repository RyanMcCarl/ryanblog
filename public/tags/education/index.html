      <p>I appeared on Russia Today (RT) yesterday to discuss the U.S./NATO intervention in Libya as well as the situation in Syria - feel free to check it out if you are interested:</p>

<p>My related article, &ldquo;Rolling the Dice in Libya,&rdquo; appeared on Antiwar.com yesterday.
Another, unrelated op-ed of mine appeared yesterday as well in the Michigan Education Report: &ldquo;National standards will stifle innovation.&rdquo; In it, I argue that &ldquo;strict standards risk forcing students and teachers alike into a curricular straitjacket, alienating creative teachers and sapping the motivation of students.</p>

How to Think About Politics
Ryan McCarl
First, question everything, beginning with the political ideas you inherited from your parents, family, community, church, and school.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      A few of my recent posts at Wide Awake Minds, in case you missed them:
-A few of the things you can do in a great university, in which I argue that if students want to make the most of their school years in general and their college years in particular, they must take ownership of their education and elect to do what is difficult. I propose a few of the ways in which college students can do so.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      Mark C. Taylor, contrarian philosopher and chair of Columbia University&rsquo;s Department of Religion, caused a firestorm in the academic community with his op-ed, &ldquo;End the University as We Know It,&rdquo; in yesterday&rsquo;s New York Times. The op-ed remains at the top of the NYT&rsquo;s most-emailed list.
There are few better places to have a debate about the philosophy of education than the University of Chicago, where the Core Curriculum and the school&rsquo;s historical emphasis on liberal education and distaste for vocational education permeates everything.

      Happy New Year! At the end of each of the past three years, I&rsquo;ve written a post listing the best books I&rsquo;ve read over the course of the year in order to bring these books to the attention of others. My lists from 2007 and 2006 are available here and here.
As usual, I&rsquo;ve put the titles of the five books most important to me this year in bold, and I&rsquo;ve linked each book to its Amazon.

      Despite insistent demands by minority groups, principally Catholics, but including Jews, Presbyterians, Baptists, and Methodists, for equal funding for their free schools, the common school movement soon achieved a monopoly of public funding. Many states even adopted constitutional provisions barring state funding of religious schools, and a federal constitutional amendment to that effect was narrowly defeated in Congress. The opposition to particularistic private schools grew to the extent that, in the early twentieth century, some states passed laws forbidding the education of children in languages other than English and banning private schools altogether.

      There are many reasons policymakers seek to impose detailed curriculum mandates. They may fundamentally distrust educators: Much of the current standards movement is just the latest episdoe in a long, sorry history of trying to create a teacher-proof curriculum.
&hellip;
These days almost anything can be done to students and to schools, no matter how ill-considered, as long as it is done in the name of raising standards.
&hellip;
It&rsquo;s convenient for us to assume that kids who cut corners are just being lazy, because then it&rsquo;s the kids who have to be fixed.

      I just put the finishing touches on my M.A. thesis, bringing one of the most stressful months of my life to a satisfying close. 10,181 words, 45 pages, three entirely different drafts, and an ungodly amount of writing and revision. I am happy with the finished product and will turn it in tomorrow morning, then post a link to it online. My faculty advisor was John Mearsheimer, the best professor I&rsquo;ve had at the U of C and one of the most influential international relations scholars in America.

      Two must-reads on current events:
-David Brooks on the Obama-Clinton race.
-&rdquo;Bush&rsquo;s War,&rdquo; a PBS Frontline documentary with extraordinary cinematography and interviews with key players involved in the political decisions surrounding the invasion and occupation of Iraq. I highly recommend watching it (it&rsquo;s free online), or at least poking around the website a bit. The site includes an annotated video timeline and transcripts from over 400 interviews.
