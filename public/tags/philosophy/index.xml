      <description>&lt;p&gt;The following is political philosopher &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iep.utm.edu/nozick/&#34;&gt;Robert Nozick&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s incredible allegory of the &amp;ldquo;Experience Machine,&amp;rdquo; from his book &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Anarchy-State-Utopia-Robert-Nozick/dp/0465097200/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1304101535&amp;amp;sr=8-1&#34;&gt;Anarchy, State, and Utopia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.  The allegory makes a case against hedonism, the idea that sensory pleasure is the highest good:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;br /&gt;Suppose there were an experience machine that would give you any experience you desired. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name=&#39;more&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Superduper neuropsychologists could stimulate your brain so that you would think and feel you were writing a great novel, or making a friend, or reading an interesting book. All the time you would be floating in a tank, with electrodes attached to your brain. Should you plug into this machine for life, preprogramming your life’s experiences? If you are worried about missing out on desirable experiences, we can suppose that business enterprises have researched thoroughly the lives of many others. You can pick and choose from their large library or smorgasbord of such experiences, selecting your life’s experiences for, say, the next two years. After two years have passed, you will have ten minutes or ten hours out of the tank, to select the experiences of your &lt;i&gt;next&lt;/i&gt; two years. Of course, while in the tank you won’t know that you’re there; you’ll think it’s all actually happening. Others can also plug in to have the experiences they want, so there’s no need to stay unplugged to serve them. (Ignore problems such as who will service the machines if everyone plugs in.) Would you plug in? &lt;i&gt;What else can matter to us, other than how our lives feel from the inside?&lt;/i&gt; Nor should you refrain because of the few moments of distress between the moment you’ve decided and the moment you’re plugged. What’s a few moments of distress compared to a lifetime of bliss (if that’s what you choose), and why feel any distress at all if your decision &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; the best one?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What does matter to us in addition to our experiences? First, we want to &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; certain things, and not just have the experience of doing them. In the case of certain experiences, it is only because first we want to do the actions that we want the experiences of doing them or thinking we’ve done them. (But &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; do we want to do the activities rather than merely to experience them?) A second reason for not plugging in is that we want to &lt;i&gt;be&lt;/i&gt; a certain way, to be a certain sort of person. Someone floating in a tank is an indeterminate blob. There is no answer to the question of what a person is like who has long been in the tank. Is he couragous, kind, intelligent, witty, loving? It’s not merely that it’s difficult to tell; there’s no way he is. Plugging into the machine is a kind of suicide. It will seem to some, trapped by a picture, that nothing about what we are like can matter except as it gets reflected in our experiences. But why should we be concerned only with how our time is filled, but not with what we are?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thirdly, plugging into an experience machine limits us to a man-made reality, to a world no deeper or more important than that which people can construct. There is no actual contact with any deeper reality, though the experience of it can be simulated. Many persons desire to leave themselves open to such contact and to a plumbing of deeper significance. This clarifies the intensity of the conflict over psychoactive drugs, which some view as mere local experience machines, and others view as avenues to a deeper reality; what some view as equivalent to surrender to the experience machine, others view as following one of the reasons &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; to surrender!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We learn that something matters to us in addition to experience by imagining an experience machine and then realizing that we would not use it. We can continue to imagine a sequence of machines each designed to fill lacks suggested for the earlier machines. For example, since the experience machine doesn’t meet our desire to be a certain way, imagine a transformation machine which transforms us into whatever sort of person we’d like to be (compatible with our staying us). Surely one would not use the transformation machine to become as one would wish, and thereupon plug into the experience machine! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So something matters in addition to one’s experiences and what one is like. Nor is the reason merely that one’s experiences are unconnected with what one is like. For the experience machine might be limited to provide only experiences possible to the sort of person plugged in. Is it that we want to make a difference in the world? Consider then the result machine, which produces in the world any result you would produce and injects your vector input into any joint activity. I won’t pursue here the fascinating details of these or other machines. What is most disturbing about them is their living of our lives for us. Is it misguided to search for particular additional functions beyond the competence of machines to do for us? Perhaps what we desire is to live (an active verb) ourselves, in contact with reality. (And this, machines cannot do for us.) Without elaborating on the implications of this, which I believe connect surprisingly with issues about free will and causal accounts of knowledge, it’s merely worth noting the intricacy of the question of what matters for people other than their experiences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robert Nozick&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Anarchy-State-Utopia-Robert-Nozick/dp/0465097200/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1304101535&amp;amp;sr=8-1&#34;&gt;Anarchy, State, and Utopia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&amp;mdash;

      <title>Readings from Charles Taylor and Erich Auerbach</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One way to put the question I want to answer here is this: why was it virtually impossible not to believe in God in, say, 1500 in our Western society, while in 2000 many of us find this not only easy, but even inescapable?&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Important as science is to our present outlook, we mustn&amp;rsquo;t exaggerate its causal role here, and make it the main motor of the transformation.  Our encasing in secular time is also something we have brought about in the way we live and order our lives.  It has been brought about by the same social and ideological changes which have wrought disenchantment.  In particular, the disciplines of our modern civilized order have led us to measure and organize time as never before in human history.  Time has become a precious resource, not to be &amp;ldquo;wasted&amp;rdquo;.  The result has been the creation of a tight, ordered time environment.  This has enveloped us, until it comes to seem like nature.  We have constructed an environment in which we live a uniform, univocal secular time, which we try to measure and control in order to get things done.  This &amp;ldquo;time frame&amp;rdquo; deserves, perhaps more than any other facet of modernity, Weber&amp;rsquo;s famous description of a &amp;ldquo;stahlhartes Gehäuse&amp;rdquo; (iron cage).  It occludes all higher times, makes them even hard to conceive.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Augustine sees ordinary time as dispersal, distensio, losing the unity, being cut off from our past and out of touch with our future.  We get lost in our little parcel of time.  But we have an irrepressible craving for eternity, and so we strive to go beyond this.  Unfortunately, this all too often takes the form of our trying to invest our little parcel with eternal significance, and therefore divinising things, and therefore falling deeper into sin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charles Taylor&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;em&gt;A Secular Age&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it is true that man is capable of everything horrible, it is also true that the horrible always engenders counterforces and that in most epochs of atrocious occurrences the great vital forces of the human soul reveal themselves: love and sacrifice, heroism in the service of conviction, and the ceaseless search for possibilities of a purer existence.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;To write history is so difficult that most historians are forced to make concessions to the technique of legend.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;The Old Testament, in so far as it is concerned with human events, ranges through all three domains: legend, historical reporting, and interpretative historical theology.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;The Homeric poems, then, though their intellectual, linguistic, and above all syntactical culture appears to be so&amp;hellip;highly developed, are yet comparatively simple in their picture of human beings; and no less so in relation to the real life which they describe in general.  Delight in physical existence is everything to them, and their highest aim is to make that delight perceptible to us.  &amp;hellip;(The Homeric heroes) wake every morning as if it were the first day of their lives: their emotions, though strong, are simple and find expression instantly.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Far from seeking, like Homer, merely to make us forget our own reality for a few hours, (the Bible) seeks to overcome our reality: we are to fit our own life into its world, feel ourselves to be elements in its structure of universal history.  This becomes increasingly difficult the further our historical environment is removed from that of the Biblical books; and if these nevertheless maintain their claim to absolute authority, it is inevitable that they themselves be adapted through interpretative transformation.  &lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to separate the historical from the legendary in general.  Their structure is different.  Even where the legendary does not immediately betray itself by elements of the miraculous, by the repetition of well-known standard motives, typical patterns and themes, through neglect of clear details of time and place, and the like, it is generally recognizable by its composition.  It runs far too smoothly.  All cross-currents, all friction, all that is casual, secondary to the main events and themes, everything unresolved, truncated, and uncertain, which confuses the clear progress of the action and the simple orientation of the actors, has disappeared.  The historical event which we witness, or learn from the testimony of those who witnessed it, runs much more variously, contradictorily, and confusedly&amp;hellip;.  Legend arranges its material in a simple and straightforward way; it detaches it from its contemporary historical context, so that the latter will not confuse it; it knows only clearly outlined men who act from few and simple motives and the continuity of whose feelings and actions remains uninterrupted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Erich Auerbach&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;em&gt;Mimesis: The Representation of Reality in Western Literature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&amp;mdash;

      <title>Quotes from Hugo Black and Lon L. Fuller</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every departure from the principles of the law&amp;rsquo;s inner morality is an affront to man&amp;rsquo;s dignity as a responsible agent.  To judge his actions by unpublished or retrospective laws, or to order him to do an act that is impossible, is to convey to him your indifference to his powers of self-determination.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;I believe that if we were forced to select the principle that supports and infuses all human aspiration we would find it in the objective of maintaining communication with our fellows.  &amp;hellip;How and when we accomplish communication with one another can expand or contract the boundaries of life itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lon_L._Fuller&#34;&gt;Lon L. Fuller&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;ndash;&lt;em&gt;The Morality of Law&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Court&amp;rsquo;s justification for consulting its own notions rather than following the original meaning of the Constitution, as I would, apparently is based on the belief of the majority of the Court that for this Court to be bound by the original meaning of the Constitution is an intolerable and debilitating evil; that our Constitution should not be &amp;ldquo;shackled to the political theory of a particular era,&amp;rdquo; and that to save the country from the original Constitution the Court must have constant power to renew it and keep it abreast of this Court&amp;rsquo;s more enlightened theories of what is best for our society. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to me that this is an attack not only on the great value of our Constitution itself but also on the concept of a written constitution which is to survive through the years as originally written unless changed through the amendment process which the Framers wisely provided. Moreover, when a &amp;ldquo;political theory&amp;rdquo; embodied in our Constitution becomes outdated, it seems to me that a majority of the nine members of this Court are not only without constitutional power but are far less qualified to choose a new constitutional political theory than the people of this country proceeding in the manner provided by Article V.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Justice Hugo Black&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;ndash;&lt;em&gt;Harper v. Virginia State Board of Education&lt;/em&gt; (dissent); 383 U.S. 663 (1966)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one may be compelled against his conscience to render war service involving the use of arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;em&gt;Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany&lt;/em&gt;, Article IV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot consider the Bill of Rights to be an outworn 18th Century &amp;lsquo;strait jacket&amp;rsquo; as the Twining opinion did. Its provisions may be thought outdated abstractions by some. And it is true that they were designed to meet ancient evils. But they are the same kind of human evils that have emerged from century to century wherever excessive power is sought by the few at the expense of the many. In my judgment the people of no nation can lose their liberty so long as a Bill of Rights like ours survives and its basic purposes are conscientiously interpreted, enforced and respected so as to afford continuous protection against old, as well as new, devices and practices which might thwart those purposes. I fear to see the consequences of the Court&amp;rsquo;s practice of substituting its own concepts of decency and fundamental justice for the language of the Bill of Rights as its point of departure in interpreting and enforcing that Bill of Rights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Justice Hugo Black&lt;br /&gt; &amp;ndash;&lt;em&gt;Adamson v. California&lt;/em&gt; (dissent); 332 U.S. 46 (1946) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;All excerpts from Lloyd,&lt;/em&gt; Introduction to Jurisprudence (4th ed., 1979).&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&amp;mdash;

      <title>A vacation and a reading list: a personal update</title>
      <link>http://ryanmccarl.com/post/a-vacation-and-a-reading-list-a-personal-update/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 28 Jul 2009 20:01:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hard to believe how quickly things happen.  My summer term - roughly six hours a day, five days a week of education classes - is drawing to a close, and as of Friday afternoon I&amp;rsquo;ll be free for an entire month (the life of a student is good - certainly beats two or three weeks of vacation over the course of a year).  I&amp;rsquo;ll be in Colorado (Boulder, Telluride, Denver) for almost two weeks, in Chicago for one, and in Muskegon for one - as well as a few days of camping in Northern Michigan with friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whenever I prepare to travel, my thoughts quickly turn to the question of what books I will bring along and read.  I always make absurdly ambitious reading lists and pack way, way more than I could ever hope to finish, and this time is no exception.  I am bringing four:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charles Taylor, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Secular-Age-Charles-Taylor/dp/0674026764&#34;&gt;A Secular Age&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.  About the rise of secularism in Western society.  Considered one of the most important books in the field of religious studies in recent decades.  Weighs in at a hefty 776 pages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John Cheever, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/John-Cheever-Collected-Stories-Writings/dp/1598530348/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1248827741&amp;sr=8-2&#34;&gt;Collected Stories and Other Writings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.  Cheever is one of the best short fiction writers of the 20th century.  969 pages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Erich Auerbach, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Mimesis-Representation-Reality-Western-Literature/dp/069111336X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1248826434&amp;sr=8-1&#34;&gt;Mimesis: The Representation of Reality in Western Literature&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;em&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/em&gt; says: &amp;ldquo;The author, beginning with Homer and the Bible, traces the imitation of life in literature through the ages &amp;hellip;touching upon every major literary figure in western culture on the way.&amp;rdquo;  A key work in 20th-century literary criticism.  574 pages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dennis Lord Lloyd of Hampstead, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.librarything.com/work/3078393/details&#34;&gt;Introduction to Jurisprudence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.  A vast, out-of-print, fantastically rich collection of writings on the philosophy of law and political philosophy - a mangled old book I believe I picked up for free in the box outside of the Powell&amp;rsquo;s Books in Hyde Park, Chicago.  981 pages (but I&amp;rsquo;ll skip writings that I don&amp;rsquo;t want to read for whatever reason).  From the &lt;em&gt;Independent&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s interesting &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-lord-lloyd-of-hampstead-1477249.html&#34;&gt;obituary&lt;/a&gt; of Lloyd: &amp;ldquo;As important to generations of students has been his encyclopaedic Introduction to Jurisprudence (1959). Lloyd was working on the sixth edition when he died. It was through this book that law students in much of the English- speaking world came to read Kelsen, Olivecrona, Savigny, Geny, Pashukanis, giants of continental juristic thought otherwise largely inaccessible. The recipe of wise text and suitably chosen extract remains a model guide to the study of legal thought. To the text he brought his own philosophical training, his culture and his erudition. The Introduction has its detractors but it remains the standard student text on the subject.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will I succeed in finishing all of these, or any of them?  Most likely not.  If history is any guide, I&amp;rsquo;ll buy some other book or books during vacation and distract myself with those, or I&amp;rsquo;ll get heavily involved with my writing, almost as a way of avoiding my reading with a good conscience.  But if I restrict my book-reading to these four tomes and read around 118 pages a day for 27 days, I could do it - so that&amp;rsquo;s the bar I&amp;rsquo;m setting for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t wait.  Two more days of finishing my summer projects, and I&amp;rsquo;ll be free to travel, read, and write without restrictions for an entire month.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&amp;mdash;

      <title>Quotes from Czeslaw Milosz and Herman Melville</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I finished &amp;ldquo;Moby-Dick&amp;rdquo; yesterday. It was one of the most difficult books I&amp;rsquo;ve ever read - but also incredibly beautiful and rewarding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The past is inaccurate, because we cannot determine how it was in fact, no matter how hard we try.  We must rely on people&amp;rsquo;s memory, which is treacherous, because memory is constantly juggling and revising the data of experience.  &amp;hellip;In telling about an event, we ourselves cannot avoid revising it, because our narrative simplifies and composes a whole out of selected components, while omitting others.  It suffices to compare our knowledge of facts with their depiction in chronicles, journalistic accounts, memoirs, to understand the need for fantasizing that is somehow inscribed in the language itself, and which draws us into the forest of fiction.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Los Angeles horrifies me.  In our imagination money is still steel and the production of factories; it is difficult to accustom oneself to the great change, the complete reversal, that has granted a marginal human activity, entertainment, its central position as a source of money or power.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;I am moved by the very fact of that woman&amp;rsquo;s existence, of which all that has remained is this verse.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;I know my own weakness and am inclined to consider myself&amp;hellip;as a tangle of reflexes, a drunken child in the fog.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;The essential characteristic of fame is its illusory nature, for what does a famous name mean if those who mention it are not well-informed about why it is famous?  That, after all, is the fate of the majority of monuments in every large city; they turn into signs from which the content has evaporated.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Everything that enlarges man fortifies us; everything that depicts him as a multidimensional being.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Czeslaw Milosz&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;ndash;&lt;em&gt;Milosz&amp;rsquo;s ABCs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A whole hour now passed; gold-beaten out to ages.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;What a lovely day again! were it a new-made world, and made for a summer-house to the angels, and this morning the first of its throwing open to them, a fairer day could not dawn upon that world.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Ah! how they still strove through that infinite blueness to seek out the thing that might destroy them!&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;But Ahab&amp;rsquo;s glance was averted; like a blighted fruit tree he shook, and cast his last, cindered apple to the soil.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Close! stand close to me, Starbuck; let me look into a human eye; it is better than to gaze into sea or sky; better than to gaze upon God.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;What! how can you see better of a dark night than anybody else, never mind how foolish?&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Old man of oceans! of all this fiery life of thine, what at length will remain but one little heap of ashes!&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Let faith oust fact; let fancy oust memory; I look deep down and do believe.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Would to God these blessed calms would last. But the mingled, mingling threads of life are woven by warp and woof: calms crossed by storms, a storm for every calm. There is no steady unretracing progress in this life; we do not advance through fixed gradations, and at the last one pause: - through infancy&amp;rsquo;s unconscious spell, boyhood&amp;rsquo;s thoughtless faith, adolescence&amp;rsquo; doubt (the common doom), then scepticism, then disbelief, resting at last in manhood&amp;rsquo;s pondering repose of If. But once gone through, we trace the round again; and are infants, boys, and men, and Ifs eternally. Where lies the final harbor, whence we unmoor no more? in what rapt ether sails the world, of which the weariest will never weary?&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;I like a good grip; I like to feel something in this slippery world that can hold, man.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Seat thyself sultanically among the moons of Saturn, and take high abstracted man alone; and he seems a wonder, a grandeur, and a woe. But from the same point, take mankind in mass, and for the most part, they seem a mob of unnecessary duplicates, both contemporary and hereditary. But most humble though he was, and far from furnishing an example of the high, humane abstraction; the Pequod&amp;rsquo;s carpenter was no duplicate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hermann Melville&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;ndash;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.princeton.edu/~batke/moby/&#34;&gt;Moby-Dick&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&amp;mdash;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;From&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;The Man-Moth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He thinks the moon is a small hole at the top of the sky,&lt;br /&gt;proving the sky quite useless for protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;Elizabeth Bishop&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;From&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Mourning Poem for the Queen of Sunday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh who and oh who will sing Jesus down&lt;br /&gt;to help with struggling and doing without and being colored&lt;br /&gt;all through blue Monday?&lt;br /&gt;Till way next Sunday?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;Robert Hayden&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;From&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Questions of Travel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should we have stayed at home,&lt;br /&gt;wherever that may be?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;Elizabeth Bishop&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;From&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Maximus, to Himself&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is undone business&lt;br /&gt;I speak of, this morning,&lt;br /&gt;with the sea&lt;br /&gt;stretching out&lt;br /&gt;from my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;Charles Olson&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again: as the profound calm which only apparently precedes and prophesies of the storm, is perhaps more awful than the storm itself; for, indeed, the calm is but the wrapper and envelope of the storm; and contains it in itself, as the seemingly harmless rifle holds the fatal powder, and the ball, and the explosion; so the graceful repose of the line, as it silently serpentines about the oarsmen before being brought into actual play - this is a thing which carries more of true terror than any other aspect of this dangerous affair. But why say more? All men live enveloped in whale-lines. All are born with halters round their necks; but it is only when caught in the swift, sudden turn of death, that mortals realize the silent, subtle, ever-present perils of life. And if you be a philosopher, though seated in the whale-boat, you would not at heart feel one whit more of terror, than though seated before your evening fire with a poker, and not a harpoon, by your side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hermann Melville&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;em&gt;Moby-Dick&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Poems excerpted from &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Norton-Anthology-Modern-Contemporary-Poetry/dp/039332429X&#34;&gt;The Norton Anthology of Modern and Contemporary Poetry&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&amp;mdash;

      <title>Mark C. Taylor on &#39;reforming higher education&#39;</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.markctaylor.com/&#34;&gt;Mark C. Taylor&lt;/a&gt;, contrarian philosopher and chair of Columbia University&amp;rsquo;s Department of Religion, caused a firestorm in the academic community with his op-ed, &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/27/opinion/27taylor.html?_r=1&#34;&gt;End the University as We Know It&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;rdquo; in yesterday&amp;rsquo;s &lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34; style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;New York Times&lt;/span&gt;.  The op-ed remains at the top of the NYT&amp;rsquo;s most-emailed list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are few better places to have a debate about the philosophy of education than the University of Chicago, where the Core Curriculum and the school&amp;rsquo;s historical emphasis on liberal education and distaste for vocational education permeates everything.  On the U of C men&amp;rsquo;s cross country email list, five current and former runners had weighed in on Taylor&amp;rsquo;s piece by this morning.  My thoughts were these:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  You can&amp;rsquo;t wish away the disciplines.  I would argue that you can familiarize yourself with several disciplines and do interdisciplinary work, but &amp;ldquo;interdisciplinary&amp;rdquo; means within and among the disciplines.  Examining a problem or topic in the abstract before locating oneself in a discipline, or in several disciplines, could easily lead to amateurism and reinventing the wheel, and it would likely lead to missing or mistaking the assumptions upon which existing scholarship has been built.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it make sense to look at questions through as many  disciplinary lenses as possible?  Absolutely.  And yet the critical advantage provided by writing within a discipline, and what an ad hoc interdisciplinary analysis of a topic risks missing, is clarity of assumptions.  You always know the outlines of where a Chicago School economist or a realist in IR theory or a Frankfurt School critic is coming from, and that helps you understand the nuances and innovations of his or her argument.  If you begin a research project with the idea that you are writing something above and beyond the disciplines, something entirely new, chances are good that 1. you are mistaken, 2. you will do work that has been done more thoroughly before, and 3. you will be forced to make arbitrary choices at every step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Taylor bases his argument on economic grounds, not educational or philosophy of education grounds.  And so he speaks of academic journals and University presses in terms of &amp;ldquo;demand&amp;rdquo; for their &amp;ldquo;products,&amp;rdquo; as if they were inferior versions of Newsweek and Random House.  If we are to do interdisciplinary work, then we must learn when and how to apply the conceptual lenses of each discipline appropriately.  By choosing to give primacy to a view of American higher education as seen through the disciplinary lenses of economics, Taylor implicitly endorses the value choices or axioms that form the foundation of contemporary economic thinking and suggests that these should govern our thinking about higher education.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is true that we can learn something new about higher education by looking at it through economic lenses, but I would suggest that the central purposes of higher education differ from the purposes of the market (efficiency, profit, increased &amp;ldquo;utility&amp;rdquo;/pleasure).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The twofold purpose of graduate programs is, first, to train scholars who can contribute, in whatever small way, to the sum of human knowledge, and second, to train these scholars to teach at the undergraduate level; if we judge that these are valuable and necessary functions in our society, as I believe we must, then we ought not to begin our critique of them with the question of what the consumer or the market &amp;ldquo;wants.&amp;rdquo;  I would also add that strong universities are at least partially public goods that add value to society and humanity at large, not just to the undergraduates they teach, and so it is a mistake to think of higher education as merely a collection of transactions between colleges and students.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  If I am right in claiming that one of the central purposes of graduate education is to contribute to the sum of human knowledge - to train scholars, not just advanced students - then I&amp;rsquo;m afraid that Taylor&amp;rsquo;s idea of substituting Powerpoint presentations and video games for dissertations misses the point, as does his suggestion that we introduce non-academic vocational training into graduate education.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;Ryan McCarl&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Mark Taylor&amp;rsquo;s original op-ed is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/27/opinion/27taylor.html?_r=1&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&amp;mdash;

I am 30 pages into Kohak&amp;rsquo;s &lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34; style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;The Embers and the Stars: A Philosophical Inquiry into the Moral Sense of Nature&lt;/span&gt;, and it is incredible so far.  A few excerpts below, with more to come.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt;Reflection and speculation remain no more than cunningly devised fables if they are not grounded in what, paraphrasing Calvin Schrag, we could call the prephilosophical and prescientific matrix of self-understanding and world-comprehension.  Though philosophy must do much else as well, it must, initially, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34; style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt;see&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt; and, thereafter, ground its speculation ever anew in seeing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt;It is, surely, good that there are synthetic medicines to ease the surplus of pain, telephones to break through loneliness, and electric lights to keep the wayfarer from stumbling.  There is, though, something wrong when we use medicine to deaden our sensitivity, when we obliterate solitude with electronics and blind ourselves with the very lights we devised to help us see.  There is nothing wrong with our artifacts; there &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34; style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt;is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt;something wrong with us: we have lost sight of the sense, the purpose of our production and our products.  Artifacts, finally, are good only extrinsically, as tools.  They have no intrinsic sense of their own.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt;My primary tool has been the metaphor, not the argument, and the product of my labors is not a doctrine but an invitation to look and see.  With Husserl, I have sought not to instruct but to point out, to recall what we have forgotten.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt;Contrary to Descartes, long before the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34; style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt;cogito&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt; of reflection there is the goodness and the truth of the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34; style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt;sumus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt;.

Through the ages of humanity&amp;rsquo;s precarious survival on this earth, the meeting of basic survival needs provided a ready justification for productive activity.  Were we inclined so to direct our energies, it might still do so: there is more than enough hunger and sheer dismal misery still with us.  For the most part, though, we manage to ignore such need.  The logic of our production is not that of need but of affluence with lacks such automatic justification.  If affluence is to be justified, it cannot be by need but by some greater good, be it meeting the needs of others, caring for the natural world, or creating higher values of culture.  &amp;hellip;Yet individually and collectively we sacrifice precious life and resources to producing and paying for [items such as ever-larger television sets] - and we are constantly assured that we must do so to &amp;ldquo;stimulate the economy.&amp;rdquo;  Production itself has become the justification of ever more absurd consumption: we consume to proudce, produce to consume; all other considerations must stand aside.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt;The heavens may still declare the glory of God, but we look up not at the heavens but at neon reflected on smog; we walk not on the good earth but on asphalt.  Our estrangement from nature is no longer conceptual only: it has acquired an experiential grounding.  Figuratively, we are all in the position of the child who has never seen, never mind milked, a cow, and whose lived experience constantly provides an experiential confirmation for the assumption that milk comes from a supermarket cooler.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt;If the products of human &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34; style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt;techne&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt; become philosophically and experientially problematic, it is, I would submit, because we come to think of them as autonomous of the purpose which led to their production and gives them meaning.  We become, in effect, victims of a self-forgetting, losing sight of the moral sense which is the justification of technology.  Quite concretely, the purpose of electric light is to help humans see.  When it comes to blind them to the world around them, it becomes counterproductive.  The task thus is not to abolish technology but to see through it to the human meaning which justifies it and directs its use.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Erazim Kohak  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34; style=&#34;font-style: italic; &#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://books.google.com/books?id=GvI0xlwoMesC&amp;amp;dq=the+embers+and+the+stars&amp;amp;source=gbs_summary_s&amp;amp;cad=0&#34;&gt;The Embers and the Stars: A Philosophical Inquiry into the Moral Sense of Nature&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&amp;mdash;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Happy New Year!  At the end of each of the past three years, I&amp;rsquo;ve written a post listing the best books I&amp;rsquo;ve read over the course of the year in order to bring these books to the attention of others.  My lists from 2007 and 2006 are available &lt;a href=&#34;http://ryanmccarl.blogspot.com/2007/12/2007-book-recommendations.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://ryanmccarl.blogspot.com/2006/12/nothing-like-reading-list-to-start-new.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As usual, I&amp;rsquo;ve put the titles of the five books most important to me this year in bold, and I&amp;rsquo;ve linked each book to its Amazon.com page.

      <title>Quotes from Harrison&#39;s &#39;Returning to Earth&#39;</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was good to finally know that the spirit was everywhere rather than a separate thing.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Clare fed our leftover sandwiches to a stray mutt, who didn&amp;rsquo;t chew the proper thirty-two times.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;All of my jobs had kept me grounded in actual life whereas simply sitting in my room with my studies tended to make me unstable.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;In New York City the endless blocks of huge buildings say to us, I&amp;rsquo;m serious and within me serious people are doing serious things even though five thousand people in a building might only be playing with the market edge.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a local euphemism in the U.P. that you&amp;rsquo;re not lost, you just can&amp;rsquo;t find your vehicle.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;A local politician rejecting foreign languages in a school budget had said, &amp;lsquo;If English was good enough for Jesus Christ it&amp;rsquo;s good enough for our kids.&amp;rsquo;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;I agreed with K on the addition of what is called a &amp;lsquo;space blanket&amp;rsquo; to the survival kits I put together and distribute for Mexicans intending to migrate north.  Space blankets are sheets of material used by campers to protect them from cold and dampness but I thought they could also defend against the summer heat of the ground, which reaches over one hundred and fifty degrees.  ..The packet was in a Velcro latched bag and could be attached to a waiste belt and weighed a little less than five pounds.  I distributed these free of charge to workers&amp;rsquo; groups and through left-leaning Catholic priests.  I was opposed by many on both sides of the border for political reasons, which didn&amp;rsquo;t bother me except for the legal expenses I incurred avoiding prosecution by the United States.  My raison d&amp;rsquo;etre was simple on the surface.  Estimates of crossing deaths along the entire nineteen-hundred-mile border with Mexico went as high as two thousand a year.  I had learned to be goofy rather than logically argumentative with my opponents.  I&amp;rsquo;d ask, If you could prevent twenty major airline disasters each year, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you?&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;By common consent we didn&amp;rsquo;t talk about anything more serious than the food and music, which in themselves have become more serious as I get older.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;He needed Montana but he also needed Chicago for her museums, libraries, theaters, bookstores, and most of all classical music, which he preferred to hear live.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;After a passing glance I averted my eyes from a photo of Carla and me at the cabin and then I fixed on it.  Was I ever that young?&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;There are no damaged goods when everyone is damaged goods.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about travel, though, is that it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to be consumed by the past against the backdrop of a fresh landscape.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lsquo;I was sorry to hear about Donald.  There was a man who could put in a day&amp;rsquo;s work.&amp;rsquo; I shook his hand as he offered this ultimate compliment of the north.  His hand felt like a semipetrified baseball mitt.  &amp;lsquo;You might not remember me.  Donny and me played football way back when, then worked together.  The name&amp;rsquo;s Teddy.&amp;rsquo;  He bowed, his face reddening, and walked away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lsquo;You were the left tackle,&amp;rsquo; I called out and he turned and grinned.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;On all levels the main reason to live is because you&amp;rsquo;re already alive.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;While we were out on the park bench a small bank of clouds came across the sun turning our mood somber.  He said, &amp;lsquo;After all, the fact of death is the most brutal thing we humans are forced to accept,&amp;rsquo; but then the sun came out again and I told him that the day after the burial Herald had said, &amp;lsquo;Mother, it can&amp;rsquo;t be awful if it happens to every living thing.&amp;rsquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jim Harrison&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;ndash;&lt;em&gt;Returning to Earth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy Jim Harrison&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;True North&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Returning-to-Earth/Jim-Harrison/e/9780802143310/?itm=3&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Returning to Earth&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://search.barnesandnoble.com/True-North/Jim-Harrison/e/9780802142061/?itm=1&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&amp;mdash;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;From&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ldquo;Desert Places&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They cannot scare me with their empty spaces&lt;br /&gt;Between stars - on stars where no human race is.&lt;br /&gt;I have it in me so much nearer home&lt;br /&gt;To scare myself with my own desert places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;Robert Frost&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One cannot remove anxiety by arguing it away.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;The affirmation of one&amp;rsquo;s essential being in spite of desires and anxieties creates joy.  Lucillus is exhorted by Seneca to make it his business &amp;ldquo;to learn how to feel joy.&amp;rdquo;  It is not the joy of fulfilled desires to which he refers, for real joy is a &amp;ldquo;severe matter&amp;rdquo;; it is the happiness of a soul which is &amp;ldquo;lifted above every circumstance.&amp;rdquo;  Joy accompanies the self-affirmation of our essential being in spite of the inhibitions coming from the accidental elements in us.  Joy is the emotional expression of the courageous Yes to one&amp;rsquo;s own true being.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul Tillich&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;em&gt;The Courage to Be&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To the Harbormaster&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to be sure to reach you&lt;br /&gt;though my ship was on the way it got caught&lt;br /&gt;in some moorings. I am always tying up&lt;br /&gt;and then deciding to depart. In storms and&lt;br /&gt;at sunset, with the metallic coils of the tide&lt;br /&gt;around my fathomless arms, I am unable&lt;br /&gt;to understand the forms of my vanity&lt;br /&gt;or I am hard alee with my Polish rudder&lt;br /&gt;in my hand and the sun sinking. To&lt;br /&gt;you I offer my hull and the tattered cordage&lt;br /&gt;of my will. The terrible channels where&lt;br /&gt;the wind drives me against the brown lips&lt;br /&gt;of the reeds are not all behind me. Yet&lt;br /&gt;I trust the sanity of my vessel; and&lt;br /&gt;if it sinks it may well be in answer&lt;br /&gt;to the reasoning of the eternal voices,&lt;br /&gt;the waves which have kept me from reaching you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ndash;Frank O&amp;rsquo;Hara&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sceptical age hungers after the definite, after something it can pretend to believe.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;You read, as a child who has listened to ghost stories goes into a dark room; it is no accurate information about historical things that you seek, it is the thrill which mere reality would never satisfy.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;The history of literary criticism is largely the history of a vain struggle to find a terminology which will define something.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;It is dawn at Jerusalem while midnight hovers above the Pillars of Hercules.  All ages are contemporaneous.  The Middle Ages are in Russia.  The future stirs already in the minds of the few.  This is especially true of literature, where the real time is independent of the apparent, and where many dead men are our grandchildren&amp;rsquo;s contemporaries, while many of our contemporaries have been already gathered into Abraham&amp;rsquo;s bosom, or some more fitting receptacle.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;The history of an art is the history of masterwork, not of failures, or mediocrity.  The ominscient historian would display the masterpieces, their causes and their inter-relation.  The study of literature is hero-worship.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Good art never bores one.  By that I mean that it is the business of the artist to prevent ennui; in the literary art, to relieve, refresh, revive the mind of the reader - at reasonable intervals - with some form of ecstasy, by some splendor of thought, some presentation of sheer beauty, some lightning turn of phrase - laughter is no mean ecstasy.  Good art begins with an escape from dullness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ezra Pound&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;em&gt;The Spirit of Romance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&amp;mdash;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The following list includes the books I&amp;rsquo;ve read this year that I enjoyed the most and that had the biggest effect on me.  I give the highest recommendation to all of them, and I&amp;rsquo;ve bolded the top five.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Akhmatova, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Selected-Poems-Anna-Akhmatova/dp/0939010615/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1198804019&amp;amp;sr=1-2&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;Selected Poems&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: bold;&#34;&gt;Bonhoeffer, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style: italic;

      <title>Quotes from James, Meredith, Campbell, and Jung</title>
      <link>http://ryanmccarl.com/post/quotes-from-james-meredith-campbell-and-jung/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;His lack of all thought by which to weigh the danger against the attractiveness of the bait, and of all volition to remain hungry a little while longer, is the direct measure of his lowness in the mental scale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;William James&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;ndash;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;The Principles of Psychology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But whether small or great, and no matter what the stage or grade of life, the call (to adventure) rings up the curtain, always, on a mystery of transfiguration - a rite, or moment, of spiritual passage, which, when complete, amounts to a dying and a birth.  The familiar life horizon has been outgrown; the old concepts, ideals, and emotional patterns no longer fit; the time for the passing of a threshold is at hand.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Refusal of the summons converts the adventure into its negative.  Walled in boredom, hard work, or &amp;ldquo;culture,&amp;rdquo; the subject loses the power of significant affirmative action and becomes a victim to be saved.  His flowering world becomes a wasteland of dry stones and his life feels meaningless&amp;hellip;.  Whatever house he builds, it will be a house of death: a labyrinth of cyclopean walls to hide from him his Minotaur.  &amp;hellip;The myths and folk tales of the whole world make clear that the refusal is essentially a refusal to give up what one takes to be one&amp;rsquo;s own interest.  The future is regarded not in terms of an unremitting series of deaths and births, but as though one&amp;rsquo;s present system of ideals, virtues, goals, and advantages were to be fixed and made secure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joseph Campbell&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;ndash;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;The Hero With a Thousand Faces&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Romeo wants Juliet as the filings want the magnet; and if no obstacles intervene he moves toward her by as straight a line as they.  But Romeo and Juliet, if a wall be built between them, do not remain idiotically pressing their faces against its opposite sides like the magnet and the filings with the card.  Romeo soon finds a circuitous way, by scaling the wall or otherwise, of touching Juliet&amp;rsquo;s lips directly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;William James&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;ndash;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;The Principles of Psychology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(The introvert&amp;rsquo;s) ideal is a lonely island where nothing moves except what he permits to move.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carl Jung&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;ndash;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;Psychological Types&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all ages the man whose determinations are swayed by reference to the most distant ends has been held to possess the highest intelligence.  The tramp who lives from hour to hour; the bohemian whose engagements are from day to day; the bachelor who builds but for a single life; the father who acts for another generation; the patriot who thinks of a whole community and many generations; and finally, the philosopher and saint whose cares are for humanity and for eternity, - these range themselves in an unbroken hierarchy&amp;hellip;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;William James&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;ndash;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;The Principles of Psychology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read, I love&lt;br /&gt;I eat, I drink&lt;br /&gt;I watch the world tilt&lt;br /&gt;I watch the children think:&lt;br /&gt;there&amp;rsquo;s so much to it&lt;br /&gt;and most of it good&lt;br /&gt;that while I&amp;rsquo;ve tendons&lt;br /&gt;to lift my head,&lt;br /&gt;like a rooster drinking&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll nod to God&lt;br /&gt;and save despair&lt;br /&gt;for when I&amp;rsquo;m dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;William Meredith&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;ndash;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;From &lt;/span&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Preponderance&amp;rdquo;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&amp;mdash;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Never does one do evil so fully and so gaily as when one does it as a matter of conscience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;Pensee&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;895&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a man&amp;rsquo;s virtue is capable of is not to be measured by his exceptional efforts, but by his daily life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;Pensee 352&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He must have movements of humiliation, not as a consequence of his nature, but of penitence; not as a constant attitude, but to permit him to rise to elevation.  He must have movements of elevation, not because of his merit, but through grace, and after passing through humiliation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;Pensee 525&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, what advantage is there for us in hearing a man say that he has shaken off the yoke, that he does not believe there is a God watching over his actions, that he considers himself as sole master of his own conduct, and that he intends to be accountable to no one but himself?  Does he think he has inclined us in this way to have henceforth much confidence in him, and to expect from him consolation, counsel, and assistance in all the emergencies of life?  Do such people claim to have caused us to rejoice by telling us that they consider that our soul is only a little wind and smoke, and even by telling us so in a proud and smug tone of voice?  Is that really something to be said gaily?  Is it not on the contrary something to be said sadly, as the saddest thing in the world?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;Pensee 194&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Faith declares indeed what the senses do not say but never the contrary of what they perceive.  Faith is above, and not against.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;Pensee 265&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is being superstitious to put one&amp;rsquo;s hope in rites; but one is guilty of overweening pride in refusing to submit to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;Pensee 294&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just examine whether a given pleasure is stable or fleeting; if it passes, it is a river of Babylon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;Pensee 459&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not from space that I must seek my dignity, but it is from the ordering of my thought.  The possession of lands would give me nothing more.  By space, the universe envelops me.  By thought, I envelop it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;Pensee 348&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They imagine that, if they had obtained that post, they would rest afterwards with pleasure; but they do not recognize the insatiable nature of their desire.  They believe that they are sincerely seeking repose, and in reality they seek only agitation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;Pensee 139&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&amp;mdash;

      <title>Quotes from John Steinbeck&#39;s &#39;Travels with Charley&#39;</title>
      <link>http://ryanmccarl.com/post/quotes-from-john-steinbecks-travels-with-charley/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A dog, particularly an exotic like Charley, is a bond between strangers.  Many conversations en route began with &amp;ldquo;What degree of a dog is that?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dairy man had a Ph.D. in mathematics, and he must have had some training in philosophy.  He liked what he was doing and he didn&amp;rsquo;t want to be somewhere else - one of the very few contented people I met in my whole journey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then a submarine slipped to the surface half a mile away, and the day lost part of its brightness.  Farther away another dark creature slashed through the water, and another; of course they are based in New London, and this is their home.  And perhaps they are keeping the world&amp;rsquo;s peace with their venom.  I wish I could like submarines, for then I might find them beautiful, but they are designed for destruction, and while they may explore and chart the sea bottom, and draw new trade lines under the Arctic ice, their main purpose is threat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who doesn&amp;rsquo;t like to be a center for concern?  A kind of second childhood falls on so many men.  They trade their violence for the promise of a small increase of life span.  In effect, the head of the house becomes the youngest child.  And I have searched myself for this possibility with a kind of horror.  For I have always lived violently, drunk hugely, eaten too much or not at all, slept around the clock or missed two nights of sleeping, worked too hard and too long in glory, or slobbed for a time in utter laziness.  I&amp;rsquo;ve lifted, pulled, chopped, climbed, made love with joy and taken my hangovers as a consequence, not as a punishment.  I did not want to surrender fierceness for a small gain in yardage.  My wife married a man; I saw no reason why she should inherit a baby. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw in their eyes something I was to see over and over in every part of the nation - a burning desire to go, to move, to get under way, anyplace, away from any Here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The word &amp;ldquo;Ftt&amp;rdquo; usually means he would like to salute a bush or a tree.  I opened the cab door and let him out, and he went about his ceremony.  He doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to think about it to do it well.  It is my experience that in some areas Charley is more intelligent than I am, but in others he is abysmally ignorant.  He can&amp;rsquo;t read, can&amp;rsquo;t drive a car, and has no grasp of mathematics.  But in his own field of endeavor, which was now practicing, the slow, imperial smelling over and anointing of an area, he has no peer.  Of course his horizons are limited, but how wide are mine?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-John Steinbeck, &lt;em&gt;Travels with Charley in Search of America &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Personal note: Steinbeck is my favorite American writer, and &lt;em&gt;Travels with Charley &lt;/em&gt;is on track to become one of my absolute favorite books; I&amp;rsquo;m especially excited about it because my family just got a second dog, a black retriever named Maggie.  I&amp;rsquo;ll get to meet Maggie for the first time when I go home to Muskegon on Friday for a Counting Crows concert.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&amp;mdash;
