      I just put the finishing touches on my M.A. thesis, bringing one of the most stressful months of my life to a satisfying close. 10,181 words, 45 pages, three entirely different drafts, and an ungodly amount of writing and revision. I am happy with the finished product and will turn it in tomorrow morning, then post a link to it online. My faculty advisor was John Mearsheimer, the best professor I&rsquo;ve had at the U of C and one of the most influential international relations scholars in America.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      This is turning out to be one of the busiest times of my life, so I won’t be posting very much over the next nine weeks. For one thing, my coursework is forcing me to put most of my personal reading list on the back-burner, so I’ll have fewer excerpts to share.
Despite the academic stress, however, things are better than ever. My classes are awesome – a Ph.D.-level seminar in Japanese literature of the 1920s and 30s taught from a Marxist perspective (the first time I’ve really had to grapple with critical theory), the third quarter of elementary Norwegian (which I’m taking in the hope of traveling to Norway and studying Knut Hamsun and other Norwegian writers in the original language), the third quarter of fourth-year modern Japanese (which amounts to taking a course with a top-notch private tutor, as there are only three of us in the class), and Jean-Bethke Elshtain’s course on the Just War tradition – a Divinity School course offering a perspective on war and peace that is completely different from the realist perspective of the political science department that I’m used to hearing.

      The following list includes the books I&rsquo;ve read this year that I enjoyed the most and that had the biggest effect on me. I give the highest recommendation to all of them, and I&rsquo;ve bolded the top five.
Akhmatova, Selected Poems
Bonhoeffer, Letters and Papers From Prison
Cumings, Korea’s Place in the Sun
de Bary, Sources of Japanese Tradition
Frye, The Educated Imagination

    <div class="article-style">
      
      The following editorial was published in this morning&rsquo;s Philadelphia Inquirer:
I was thrilled to learn that The Golden Compass, the first book in Philip Pullman&rsquo;s &ldquo;His Dark Materials&rdquo; trilogy, was going to be released as a movie on Friday. I read the trilogy first in middle school and again in high school, and it was my favorite story for a long time. It is filled with imagination and erudition, and it is a significant cut above the vast majority of works aimed at young adults.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      I traveled to Northfield, MN this weekend to race in the NCAA Division III Cross Country National Championships - the final cross-country race of my life. The experience was intense: the race was taped and relayed to an enormous screen for spectators; the &ldquo;boxes&rdquo; that show runners where to stand on the starting line were separated by physical barriers instead of the usual paint on the ground; huge circular blue NCAA logos were painted at the start and the finish; and the race was narrated by an announcer.

    <h2><a href="http://ryanmccarl.com/post/ucxc-midwest-regional-championships-2007/">UCXC: Midwest Regional Championships 2007</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      This was one of the best weekends of my life. It was my last team trip as a member of a collegiate cross-country squad, and memories were made. We traveled to beautiful, spacious Oshkosh, WI for the Midwest Regional meet. Shortly before the starting gun, huddling with the team, doing stride-outs, and giving high-fives, I realized that I was doing all of these things for the last time, and in a moment of clarity I understood how much cross-country has meant to me for the past 8 years.

    <h2><a href="http://ryanmccarl.com/post/ucxc-parkside-invitational-2007/">UCXC: Parkside Invitational 2007</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      It was a beautiful fall day in Kenosha, Wisconsin, and I was reminded of why I love cross-country. The course at Wisconsin-Parkside is designed specifically for cross-country: it isn&rsquo;t a golf course with a white line drawn through it. It has handmade signs marking each quarter-mile, it has hills and trails through woods, and the start is sounded with a cannon rather than a gun. From the starting line, runners look forward and see an enormous hill surrounded by trees, and above the hill, the cloud-filled Wisconsin sky.

    <h2><a href="http://ryanmccarl.com/post/ucxc-loyola-invitational-2007/">UCXC: Loyola Invitational 2007</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      Not the best day for the UCXC men: we were hoping to place around seventh or eighth at the Loyola Invitational, the gold division of which is packed with DI and DII teams, but no one ran particularly well, and we wound up in thirteenth.
In the final steps of the race, I was hit by the problem of overheating I occasionally get when I race - suddenly, all strength goes out of my limbs, moving a single step becomes a major effort, my body has begun to burn muscle instead of calories/fat, and I feel as though I might black out.
