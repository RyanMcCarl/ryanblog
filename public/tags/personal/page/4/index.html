      I had a great time in Tokyo, and now I am home - in Muskegon overnight and driving to Chicago first thing tomorrow morning. I&rsquo;ll post a few of the best pictures from the trip over the weekend.
A few of the things I did in Japan:
-Reconnected with the Japanese people with whom I am closest - Ai (a former exchange student in Muskegon) and my former host family. Had many memorable outings with friends of Ai and became close with one in particular, a guitar-playing writer/actor named Okada who, at age 23, has already published two books of poetry in Japan.

      The cross-country season got off to a great start for the UCXC men and women - the men placed our top 5 in the top 11 spots of the meet. What&rsquo;s more, we did it by starting very conservatively and gradually moving up, a tactic that allowed us to run comfortably in a pack of 7-10 runners for the first 2 1&frasl;2 miles of the 4 mile race. I don&rsquo;t remember the last time I enjoyed a race so much.

      After a quiet and happy week in Michigan, I am now back in Chicago for a week of training and racing with the U of C cross-country team. This will be my fourth and final year as a member of the squad, and I am more excited about the sport and ready to race than I&rsquo;ve been in years. We begin to miss things and feel the pain of losing them before they go, and being a member of an XC team has been a big part of my life for almost eight years.

      The internship is over and I am home in Muskegon, happy to use the weather as an excuse to spend entire days reading in coffeeshops. I am leaving for Japan on September 5th and my Japanese is very rusty, and there is plenty of IR and political theory I would like to cover before school starts in late September. This should be a wonderful week: home, family, friends, books, bowling, Muskegon, running on the lake.

      Living is more than submission: it is creation. To live is to create one&rsquo;s own world as a scene of personal happiness.
-Thomas Merton, &ldquo;The Street is For Celebration&rdquo;
Celebration is the beginning of confidence, therefore of power.
-Thomas Merton, &ldquo;The Street is For Celebration&rdquo;
The next passage in my journey is a love affair. I am in love with Montana. For other states I have admiration, respect, recognition, even some affection, but with Montana it is love, and it&rsquo;s difficult to analyze love when you&rsquo;re in it.

      I am excited about the weekend. I&rsquo;ll be walking straight from work to Union Station tomorrow afternoon, and then the usual, happy routine of a quick trip home: the #370 Pere Marquette accompanied by caffeine and books (and, since it&rsquo;s summer, a wonderful sunset over the harbor in St. Joseph, MI), a late-night outing to Pints &amp; Quarts and Pablo&rsquo;s Tacos with Muskegon friends, a Saturday morning trip to eat breakfast and shop for used books in Grand Haven, a few intense games of ping-pong with Tyler, and a run on the beach.

<p>In you, as in me, there is a hidden certainty
That soon you will rise, in undiminished light,
And be real, strong, free from what restrained you.</p>

<p>From Notes
He felt thankful, so he couldn&rsquo;t not believe in God.
From A Poetic State
Every minute the spectacle of the world astonishes me; it is so comic that I cannot understand how literature could expect to cope with it.</p>

      Happy Independence Day! I&rsquo;ll be spending a lazy Fourth revelling in freedom from work, sitting on the back porch with my roommates, and reading like crazy.
Just discovered Anna Akhmatova, a Russian poet who wrote and published under the specter of Soviet communism and Stalinism; her husband of eleven years was shot in 1921 as a &ldquo;counter-revolutionary,&rdquo; her son and lover were arrested and sent to labor camps, and she herself was regularly persecuted and followed by the secret police.

      I&rsquo;m working extremely hard and learning a lot by day, and running, reading, and spending time with my friends in the evening - it&rsquo;s a great program, and I have a lot to be grateful for. Lately I&rsquo;ve been reading the poems of Thomas Hardy, and he has become one of my favorites. Here are a few of the poems and lines that I&rsquo;ve especially liked so far:

    <div class="article-style">
      
      After finishing Steinbeck&rsquo;s East of Eden this week, I turned my attention to Dietrich Bonhoeffer&rsquo;s Letters and Papers from Prison. Bonhoeffer was an incredible man with an incredible story. He was an innovative theologian and an erudite scholar, and he wrote several highly influential books before his thirtieth birthday. Refusing to escape the fate of his family, friends, and church, Bonhoeffer - a German - turned down an invitation to repatriate to America in 1939.
