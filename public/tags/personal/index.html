    <div class="article-style">
      
      I&rsquo;ve created somewhat elaborate spreadsheets to rank NHL, NCAA Men&rsquo;s Basketball and Football, and NFL teams by averaging a number of basic and advanced statistics as well as power rankings produced by various experts. The NHL playoffs start tonight. Here is (1) how my spreadsheet ranks all of the teams in the lead, and (2) my predictions for what will happen in the playoffs:
NHL Power Rankings, 2016-17 (end of regular season)  Washington Montreal Chicago Columbus Pittsburgh Minnesota San Jose Edmonton Anaheim Boston Nashville NY Rangers St.

      UPDATE: I devoted most of my nights and weekends this year to building the program described below with the help of Kostyantyn Grinchenko, an excellent Ukrainian freelance developer. Then, after realizing that we had stumbled upon a breakthrough idea that could revolutionize language learning and help many people become fluent readers of their target language, I assembled a remote team of freelance and volunteer developers, designers, native-speaker audio recorders, and translators to help me develop it into a webapp (and future mobile app): WordBrewery.

      Last summer and fall, I did a bit of research to try and identify books and study aids that might be helpful during my first year of law school. &nbsp;There are hundreds of products out there, and some are considerably more useful than others. &nbsp;I wanted to put together a list of the books I found to be most valuable for any incoming law students (or self-educators interested in reading about law) who might be interested:

<p>My related article, &ldquo;Rolling the Dice in Libya,&rdquo; appeared on Antiwar.com yesterday.
Another, unrelated op-ed of mine appeared yesterday as well in the Michigan Education Report: &ldquo;National standards will stifle innovation.&rdquo; In it, I argue that &ldquo;strict standards risk forcing students and teachers alike into a curricular straitjacket, alienating creative teachers and sapping the motivation of students.</p>

Rolling the dice in Libya
Ryan McCarl
President Barack Obama won the Democratic nomination in 2008 partly by reminding the party’s base of his early, prescient criticisms of the ill-fated decision to invade Iraq.

How to Think About Politics
Ryan McCarl
First, question everything, beginning with the political ideas you inherited from your parents, family, community, church, and school.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      It&rsquo;s hard to believe how quickly things happen. My summer term - roughly six hours a day, five days a week of education classes - is drawing to a close, and as of Friday afternoon I&rsquo;ll be free for an entire month (the life of a student is good - certainly beats two or three weeks of vacation over the course of a year). I&rsquo;ll be in Colorado (Boulder, Telluride, Denver) for almost two weeks, in Chicago for one, and in Muskegon for one - as well as a few days of camping in Northern Michigan with friends.

      A few of my recent posts at Wide Awake Minds, in case you missed them:
-A few of the things you can do in a great university, in which I argue that if students want to make the most of their school years in general and their college years in particular, they must take ownership of their education and elect to do what is difficult. I propose a few of the ways in which college students can do so.
