    <div class="article-style">
      
      The following editorial was published in this morning&rsquo;s Philadelphia Inquirer:
I was thrilled to learn that The Golden Compass, the first book in Philip Pullman&rsquo;s &ldquo;His Dark Materials&rdquo; trilogy, was going to be released as a movie on Friday. I read the trilogy first in middle school and again in high school, and it was my favorite story for a long time. It is filled with imagination and erudition, and it is a significant cut above the vast majority of works aimed at young adults.

      And, certainly, the way to maturity in thinking is a difficult path. Much must be left behind: early dreams, poetic imaginations, cherished legends, favored doctrines, accustomed laws and ritual traditions. Some of them must be restored on a deeper level, some must be given up. Despite this price, maturity can be gained - a manly, self-critical, convincing faith, not produced by reasoning, but reasonable, and at the same time rooted in the message of the divine foolishness, the ultimate source of wisdom.

The theological dimension is needed both for interpreting and for solving present day problems in human society.
&ndash;Pope John Paul II, Centesimus Annus
The human being is made for love and cannot live without love.

      -Today&rsquo;s Maroon column: &ldquo;Certainty is a luxury none of us has.&rdquo; Religious fundamentalists and secular fundamentalists are all-too-alike in their belief that they, and only they, have answers to the biggest questions in the human dialogue. What unites us all is doubt and searching. Read the article here.
-Must-read: &ldquo;Principal of Arabic School Says She was Forced Out.&rdquo; This is what racist, nativist hysteria looks like.
-From an Economist article on the new Fox Business Channel: Mr Murdoch apparently wants his channel to be more “pro-capitalism” than CNBC—which is hardly a pinko outfit—and, sure enough, there was soon a discussion about the pharmaceutical industry entitled &ldquo;Capitalism cures cancer&rdquo;, which—let’s be “fair and balanced”, as the Fox News slogan puts it—it does.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      Not many years ago great offence was given by an eminent writer who remarked that the time had come when the history of Christianity should be treated in a truly historical spirit, in the same spirit in which we treat the history of other religions, such as Brahmanism, Buddhism, or Mohammedanism. And yet what can be truer? He must be a man of little faith, who would fear to subject his own religion to the same critical tests to which the historian subjects all other religions.

      Never does one do evil so fully and so gaily as when one does it as a matter of conscience.
&ndash;Pensee 895
What a man&rsquo;s virtue is capable of is not to be measured by his exceptional efforts, but by his daily life.
&ndash;Pensee 352
He must have movements of humiliation, not as a consequence of his nature, but of penitence; not as a constant attitude, but to permit him to rise to elevation.

      Count it all joy, my brethren, when you meet various trials, for you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness. And let steadfastness have its full effect, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking nothing.
-James 1:2-4
But be doers of the world, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves. For if any one is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who observes his natural face in a mirror: for he observes himself and goes away and at once forgets what he was like.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      After finishing Steinbeck&rsquo;s East of Eden this week, I turned my attention to Dietrich Bonhoeffer&rsquo;s Letters and Papers from Prison. Bonhoeffer was an incredible man with an incredible story. He was an innovative theologian and an erudite scholar, and he wrote several highly influential books before his thirtieth birthday. Refusing to escape the fate of his family, friends, and church, Bonhoeffer - a German - turned down an invitation to repatriate to America in 1939.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      Josef Pieper is a German, Catholic theologian in the Thomist tradition, and his writing is beautiful - curious readers of any faith (or none) will find something to appreciate in his insights. I&rsquo;ve read three of his books - The Four Cardinal Principles, Divine Madness: Plato&rsquo;s Case Against Secular Humanism, and A Brief Reader on the Virtues of the Human Heart. All three are published by Ignatius Press, which produces perhaps the most beautifully bound paperback books I am familiar with.
