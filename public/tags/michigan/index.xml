      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nick&amp;rsquo;s heart tightened as the trout moved.  He felt all the old feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;His muscles ached and the day was hot, but Nick felt happy.  He had left everything behind, the need for thinking, the need to write, other needs.  It was all back of him.  From the time he had gotten down off the train and the baggage man had thrown his pack out of the open car door things had been different.  Seney was burned, the country was burned over and changed, but it did not matter.  It could not all be burned.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;The road ran on, dipping occasionally, but always climbing.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Inside the tent the light came through the brown canvas.  It smelled pleasantly of canvas.  Already there was something mysterious and homelike.  Nick was happy as he crawled inside the tent.  He had not been unhappy all day.  This was different though.  Now things were done.  There had been this to do.  Now it was done.  It had been a hard trip.  He was very tired.  That was done.  He had made his camp.  He was settled.  Nothing could touch him.  It was a good place to camp.  He was there, in the good place.  He was in his home where he had made it.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Nick laughed.  It made a good ending to the story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ernest Hemingway&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;&amp;ldquo;Big Two-Hearted River: Part I&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;lsquo;heroes of the spirit,&amp;rsquo; Elijah shows the conventional rabbi Baroka, are not the ostentatiously pious, not even the learned and devout like Baroka himself&amp;hellip;.  They may appear to be quite ordinary individuals, not even religious in a conventional sense, whose quiet deeds enhance the quality of life around them - the carers, the compassionate, those who use their talents to ease the burden of humanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norman Solomon&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;em&gt;Judaism: A Very Short Introduction&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tide of darkness seemed to sweep him back to her, postponing from moment to moment his entry into the world of guilt and sorrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flannery O&amp;rsquo;Connor&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;&amp;ldquo;Everything That Rises Must Converge&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But no appeal has yet been made to the vast American middle class, the majority class, to detach itself from our competitive industrial insanity.  It is indeed our industrial way of life that lends sanction to militarism and colonialism, Preparedness and suppression of human rights.  Our enemy, strange as it may sound to American ears, is the Standard of Living.  We worship at the altar of the White Rhinoceros, the American kitchen.  Standard of Living is the holy of holies in whose name every other evil is committed.  To lower this standard or to equalize it among the peoples of the world is our greatest need.  And the first step is to disassociate ourselves from the industrial-scientific madness which rules our lives twenty-four hours a day.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;To remove ourselves from the world of competition is of paramount importance to the individual and to the nation.  Competition is the most terrible vice of modern society.  Competition is the disease of the West and is the source of our violence.  Non-violence means non-competition.  &amp;hellip;It cannot be employed by governments because governments are by definition committed to violence.  Nonviolence is not a prerogative of governments but of men, even of one man.  One nonviolent man, like Gandhi or Christ, can change history.  Governments can only keep history on the march.  &lt;em&gt;Ahimsa&lt;/em&gt; can stop history.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Vinoba Bhave, the greatest living disciple of Gandhi, who travels throughout India asking for land for the peasantry from the great landlords and receiving it, says: &amp;ldquo;I desire to humiliate neither the rich nor the poor&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;  This is the opposite of communist expropriation or of capitalist competition.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of class war and hatred as preached by the communists or industrial-scientific competition as preached by us, to survive we must behave nonviolently and in the spirit of love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Karl Shapiro&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;&amp;ldquo;To Revive Anarchism&amp;rdquo; in &lt;em&gt;Creative Glut&lt;/em&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&amp;mdash;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;An article I wrote about my incredible high school cross country coach, John Swinburne, was published today in the &lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34; style=&#34;font-style: italic; &#34;&gt;Muskegon Chronicle&lt;/span&gt; and on MLive.com.  Check it out &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mlive.com/sports/muskegon/index.ssf/2009/04/popular_coach_athletic_directo.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Swinburne has worked formally and informally in education as a coach, teacher, athletic director, driver&amp;rsquo;s ed instructor, youth group leader, and mentor to thousands of students in the Muskegon, MI area for four decades.  He is a truly great man who has changed many lives, including mine, through his coaching.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&amp;mdash;

alt=&#39;&#34; id=&#34;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5311272264829533522&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently finished Jim Harrison&amp;rsquo;s latest novel, &lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34; style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/English-Major-Novel-Jim-Harrison/dp/0802118631&#34;&gt;The English Major&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.  Harrison, a native of my home state of Michigan, is my favorite contemporary author, and &lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34; style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;The English Major &lt;/span&gt;is the best &amp;rdquo;fun read&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;ve had in a long time.  In trademark Harrison style, it is both hilarious and poignant, and it contains some great passages.  Excerpts below.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt;I tried to dismiss a pinprick of homesickness beneath my breastbone but then thought that homesickness like marital love was mostly a habit.  What I missed was no longer there or on the verge of disappearing.  I mean Lola was in dog heaven and the farm which had been sold to a stockbroker and his family from Chicago was to become a horse operation.  The barn and my cozy workshop would likely be remodeled into stables, the orchard uprooted for pasture, and our old home razed in favor of what Viv said would be &amp;ldquo;French provincial&amp;rdquo; whatever that was.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt;Dad once warned me about this when I was mourning the loss of a girlfriend to a quarterback.  I was a lonely lineman.  I moped and moped, and then when we were cutting wood on an icy October morning he told me that self-pity was a ruinous emotion.  &amp;rdquo;Look at the world, not up your ass,&amp;rdquo; he said.  It took me awhile to figure this out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34; style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt;She also liked to say that my dead father would wish me to be a &amp;ldquo;success&amp;rdquo; when my dad never spoke about such things except to say that successful people never had much time for important things like hunting, fishing, drinking, and wandering around in the woods.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt;Dad certainly wouldn&amp;rsquo;t own a cell phone which only made the wandering man a target with the number providing a guaranteed bull&amp;rsquo;s-eye.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt;Up to this point I hadn&amp;rsquo;t questioned the rightness of my trip but suddenly I wondered if I were truly suited for travel.  Reality seemed to be crumbling and I was wise enough to understand that reality stayed the same so it was my mind that was crumbling.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt;To my dad who was a young man during the Great Depression the only truly hopeless greivance was not to have a job, or not to have &amp;ldquo;work&amp;rdquo; as he called it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sort of neutral in terms of religion but ever since I was a kid I&amp;rsquo;ve thought moving water to be the best thing God made.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;  style=&#34;font-size:small;&#34;&gt;Everyone pretty much pans out in the middle ground or less.  In college I thought I was destined to go overseas but I didn&amp;rsquo;t.  We don&amp;rsquo;t quite get started except on our livelihood which is probably the story of mankind.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Jim Harrison&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;  &amp;ndash;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;

      <title>Quotes from Harrison&#39;s &#39;Returning to Earth&#39;</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was good to finally know that the spirit was everywhere rather than a separate thing.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Clare fed our leftover sandwiches to a stray mutt, who didn&amp;rsquo;t chew the proper thirty-two times.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;All of my jobs had kept me grounded in actual life whereas simply sitting in my room with my studies tended to make me unstable.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;In New York City the endless blocks of huge buildings say to us, I&amp;rsquo;m serious and within me serious people are doing serious things even though five thousand people in a building might only be playing with the market edge.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a local euphemism in the U.P. that you&amp;rsquo;re not lost, you just can&amp;rsquo;t find your vehicle.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;A local politician rejecting foreign languages in a school budget had said, &amp;lsquo;If English was good enough for Jesus Christ it&amp;rsquo;s good enough for our kids.&amp;rsquo;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;I agreed with K on the addition of what is called a &amp;lsquo;space blanket&amp;rsquo; to the survival kits I put together and distribute for Mexicans intending to migrate north.  Space blankets are sheets of material used by campers to protect them from cold and dampness but I thought they could also defend against the summer heat of the ground, which reaches over one hundred and fifty degrees.  ..The packet was in a Velcro latched bag and could be attached to a waiste belt and weighed a little less than five pounds.  I distributed these free of charge to workers&amp;rsquo; groups and through left-leaning Catholic priests.  I was opposed by many on both sides of the border for political reasons, which didn&amp;rsquo;t bother me except for the legal expenses I incurred avoiding prosecution by the United States.  My raison d&amp;rsquo;etre was simple on the surface.  Estimates of crossing deaths along the entire nineteen-hundred-mile border with Mexico went as high as two thousand a year.  I had learned to be goofy rather than logically argumentative with my opponents.  I&amp;rsquo;d ask, If you could prevent twenty major airline disasters each year, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you?&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;By common consent we didn&amp;rsquo;t talk about anything more serious than the food and music, which in themselves have become more serious as I get older.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;He needed Montana but he also needed Chicago for her museums, libraries, theaters, bookstores, and most of all classical music, which he preferred to hear live.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;After a passing glance I averted my eyes from a photo of Carla and me at the cabin and then I fixed on it.  Was I ever that young?&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;There are no damaged goods when everyone is damaged goods.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about travel, though, is that it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to be consumed by the past against the backdrop of a fresh landscape.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lsquo;I was sorry to hear about Donald.  There was a man who could put in a day&amp;rsquo;s work.&amp;rsquo; I shook his hand as he offered this ultimate compliment of the north.  His hand felt like a semipetrified baseball mitt.  &amp;lsquo;You might not remember me.  Donny and me played football way back when, then worked together.  The name&amp;rsquo;s Teddy.&amp;rsquo;  He bowed, his face reddening, and walked away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lsquo;You were the left tackle,&amp;rsquo; I called out and he turned and grinned.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;On all levels the main reason to live is because you&amp;rsquo;re already alive.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;While we were out on the park bench a small bank of clouds came across the sun turning our mood somber.  He said, &amp;lsquo;After all, the fact of death is the most brutal thing we humans are forced to accept,&amp;rsquo; but then the sun came out again and I told him that the day after the burial Herald had said, &amp;lsquo;Mother, it can&amp;rsquo;t be awful if it happens to every living thing.&amp;rsquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jim Harrison&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;ndash;&lt;em&gt;Returning to Earth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy Jim Harrison&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;True North&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Returning-to-Earth/Jim-Harrison/e/9780802143310/?itm=3&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Returning to Earth&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://search.barnesandnoble.com/True-North/Jim-Harrison/e/9780802142061/?itm=1&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&amp;mdash;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve made plenty of discoveries this year - a love for banjo and bluegrass, a greater appreciation for the outdoors and concern for the environment, a new appreciation for the upper Midwest, the desire (if not yet the discipline) to live more simply and learn to cook - but one of the best recent discoveries I&amp;rsquo;ve made is the fiction of Jim Harrison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently finished his &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://books.google.com/books?id=wW5CXWQNt6IC&#34;&gt;Returning to Earth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; - a novel about a very physically-oriented man who comes down with Lou Gehrig&amp;rsquo;s disease in his early 40s - and I cannot recommend it enough.  It is a sequel of sorts to Harrison&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://books.google.com/books?id=pAVWwx2g9CAC&#34;&gt;True North&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and these two books are the first I&amp;rsquo;ve read this year to make my list of fiction favorites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_dbkE5wB5Kaw/SPVs4Z9CtTI/AAAAAAAAAgU/UxfZ_-ewCW8/s1600-h/returning+to+earth.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img style=&#34;float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;&#34; src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_dbkE5wB5Kaw/SPVs4Z9CtTI/AAAAAAAAAgU/UxfZ_-ewCW8/s200/returning+to+earth.jpg&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#39;&#34;id=&#34;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5257227856320312626&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_dbkE5wB5Kaw/SPVsxC9H-lI/AAAAAAAAAgM/JxugjoVWP-A/s1600-h/truenorth.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img style=&#34;float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;&#34; src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_dbkE5wB5Kaw/SPVsxC9H-lI/AAAAAAAAAgM/JxugjoVWP-A/s200/truenorth.jpg&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#39;&#34;id=&#34;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5257227729887558226&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_dbkE5wB5Kaw/SPVsqCXCI3I/AAAAAAAAAgE/15eFmT9sDZk/s1600-h/jimharrison.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img style=&#34;float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_dbkE5wB5Kaw/SPVsqCXCI3I/AAAAAAAAAgE/15eFmT9sDZk/s320/jimharrison.jpg&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#39;&#34;id=&#34;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5257227609468707698&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following links are also worth checking out:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/25/books/25harr.html&#34;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with Jim Harrison: &amp;ldquo;Pleasures of the Hard-Worn Life&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;-&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Harrison&#34;&gt;Wikipedia article &lt;/a&gt;on Jim Harrison&lt;br /&gt;-&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/11/books/review/Blythe.t.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=2&amp;oref=slogin&#34;&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;Returning to Earth&lt;/em&gt; (warning: gives a lot away).&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&amp;mdash;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The main feature of the Kingston Plains was the thousands of acres of white pine stumps, some of them very large, which had been cut at waist or chest height probably during the winter when it was easier to skid the trees out on snow-covered trails which they dampened to form ice so that the draft horse-drawn log sleighs could be more easily pulled. &amp;hellip;I swiveled around until I had completed a 360-degree view, suppressing any anger I felt over the idea that they might have left a few trees for those in the future to look at. Maybe to try to imagine the trees was like asking a contemporary Lakota to imagine a million buffalo.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;It occurred to me that you could explain everything away but the behavior remained.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Frankly I wanted to be useful in this life and that could be defined only by work, not good intentions.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;I felt absurdly happy when I entered Michigan just north of Toledo, though I was already lonely for Riva.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Being at the university through the deaths of Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. ending with the more recent Kent State butchery had often made academic studies seem problematical and remote. How upsetting to see your professor break down in tears in your Chaucer class the day after King was murdered. My return to religion was a defense against the insanity of the time, a way to avoid standing there simply screaming like the girl in the famous Kent State photograph. I recalled the day when I was a junior at Michigan State and Cynthia had called to say that she had heard our ex-paper boy had died in Vietnam. He was a poor kid and never seemed dressed warmly enough in winter when below-zero winds blew in off Lake Superior. &amp;hellip;He put a face on an insane war.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;How soiled and tawdry poor Jesus was compared to the theological school where the self-interest of the human intelligence smothered prayer, and the abstractions in the history of theology were a virtual fire extinguisher on the Gospels.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Every location has its classic Greek chorus muttering, chattering, moaning in the background.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Fred says that when he sees a politician who has further crushed the poor pray in public he wants to pick up a gun.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;I was cold and exhausted and went back to the motel room, drew an easy chair up to the window, then fell asleep staring at the frightening whiteness of the world. It was clearly a blank canvas on which you could paint your life if you cared to. Just before sleep I imagined sitting at the cabin window and painted the interior of what would be my cabin, including the front window from which the only visible thing was Lake Superior and the line of the horizon, but there was the nagging idea Fred had explained that as a putative Christian I had to learn how to function in the world before I earned the right to retreat.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;We were jittery when we rigged our fly rods and flipped a coin for the first cast. Glenn won and caught a two-pounder and then it became apparent that the fish weren&amp;rsquo;t gun-shy so we could both cast. We caught a dozen before dark and released all but two which we kept for a midnight snack and ate with a six-pack of beer Glenn had stowed in the cold creek. The northern lights were astounding, whirling sheets and cones of rose and green and bluish lights so strong they gave off a tinny metallic sound.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Naturally during the act of love you&amp;rsquo;re undisturbed by reality, a grace note I also found in trout fishing, but then lovemaking and fishing don&amp;rsquo;t manage to dominate your life like you wished they could.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;We gave up our heavy talk and spent two days rowing. In my own life strength has come from unfolding, subtracting, rather than adding.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Clarence said a striking thing about rowing that I&amp;rsquo;ve always valued, the upshot of which was that he liked rowing because you were approaching life backward. You could clearly see the past, and you glanced quickly at the future over your shoulder mostly so you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t run into anything destructively immovable. Too much of the future was predestined by the behavior of others for you to be in control. The most you could hope for is to be ready and attentive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jim Harrison&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/True-North-Jim-Harrison/dp/0802142060/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1202245476&amp;amp;sr=8-2&#34;&gt;True North&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;(I picked up&lt;/em&gt; True North&lt;em&gt; at the Dawn Treader Book Shop (one of my favorites) in Ann Arbor, MI yesterday, and it has sucked me in and engrossed me in a way that hasn&amp;rsquo;t happened in awhile.  I read 50 pages in one sitting last night and another 150 pages on the train from Ann Arbor to Chicago this morning.  I don&amp;rsquo;t know how it ends yet, but it&amp;rsquo;s highly recommended.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&amp;mdash;
