If it was done before him, it was not recorded. Nature had been endlessly discussed, but as a generality, not as &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; landscape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Y47FlKE0hMI/TXGzHSrRQ-I/AAAAAAAABBk/JQRq9kBlJo8/s1600/barzun-time%2Bmontage-56-97.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;320&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Y47FlKE0hMI/TXGzHSrRQ-I/AAAAAAAABBk/JQRq9kBlJo8/s320/barzun-time%2Bmontage-56-97.jpg&#34; width=&#34;243&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Inquisition as such, that is, apart from methods and severity of results, has remained a live institution. The many dictatorships of the 20th century have relied on it and in free countries it thrives ad hoc - hunting down German sympathizers during the First World War, interning Japanese-Americans during the second, and pursuing Communist fellow-travelers during the Cold War.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ldquo;Heretics are given us so that we might not remain in infancy. They question, there is discussion, and definitions are arrived at to make an organized faith.&amp;rdquo; -St. Augustine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;It takes hundreds of the gifted to make half a dozen of the great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name=&#39;more&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Why is fame so capricious a goddess? In any country its favor depends on attention by one group of critics rather than another, or again by the fanatical devotion that goes to the right man at the right time. Some element of the work must chime in with some concern of the moment.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;rdquo;(Smoking) is a custom loathful to the eye, hateful to the nose, harmful to the brain, dangerous to the lungs; and the black, stinking fumes thereof nearest resembling the horrible stygian smoke of the pit that is bottomless.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash;James I of England (1604)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Desire must be dammed up to be self-renewing.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ldquo;Mankind does nothing save through initiatives on the part of inventors, great or small, and imitation by the rest of us. Individuals show the way, set the patterns, The rivalry of the patterns is the history of the world.&amp;rdquo; -William James (1908)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Where in the scheme of things do I belong? Who am I, anyway? Such questions made up the &amp;lsquo;identity crisis&amp;rsquo; studied by psychiatrists whose patients had not &amp;lsquo;found themselves.&amp;rsquo; &amp;hellip;Finding oneself was a misnomer; a self is not found but made; and the anti-hero, anti-history bias was an obstacle to making it, because a starting point from the past was missing; it had to be made from scratch.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;In Geneva under Calvin people had to go to church twice daily. &amp;hellip;If stubborn and persistent in sin, the dear soul must be turned over to the civil authorities. Adultery might mean death, quite as if Jesus had not dealt rather differently with the woman taken in adultery. Blasphemy, that curious crime of &amp;lsquo;damaging God by bringing Him into ill-repute,&amp;rsquo; was even more unforgivable. &amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Calvinism, it has been said, makes every man the enemy of every other, as well as his own. Certainly its rigor accounts for the agonizing fear of sin that has been recorded in many lives&amp;hellip;. The number of plain people, especially adolescents, whose minds were tortured by Calvinist sermons in England in America may be imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;Luther wrote that &amp;lsquo;the Christian man is dead to the world,&amp;rsquo; yet, as we saw, he relished life. The ailing Calvin was not a relisher; his advice is contradictory and leaves nature a rather narrow crack through which to manifest God&amp;rsquo;s goodness.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ldquo;Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive,&lt;br /&gt;But to be young was very heaven.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Wordsworth remembering the French Revolution&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Montaigne lived in an age full of people who knew that they, and they alone, had the truth, direct from God - and these truth-bearers all disagreed. Reflecting on a far wider set of facts and with greater self-knowledge, Montaigne was at pains to make the point that Cromwell later phrased so superbly: &amp;lsquo;By the bowels of Christ, bethink ye that ye may be mistaken.&amp;rsquo;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Erasmus loved travel and the good things of life, including the rapid, flashing conversation of learned friends in Paris, Oxford, and&amp;hellip;Basel.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;The welfare ideal did not merely see to it that the poor should be able to survive, but that everybody should be safe and at ease in a hundred ways. Besides providing health care, pensions (&amp;ldquo;social security&amp;rdquo;), and workmen&amp;rsquo;s compensation for accidents, it undertook to protect every employee by workplace regulations and every consumer by laws against harm from foods, drugs, and the multiform dangers that industry creates. All appliances were subject to design control and inspection. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;At the same time, it was also held that the state had the duty of supporting art and science, medical research, and the integrity of the environment, while it must also make sure that all children were not simply literate but educated up to and through college - rules, rules, definitions, classifications, and exceptions = indignation - and litigation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;The cost of welfare in money was huge and in mental effort exorbitant. &amp;hellip;The task of distributing benefits was alone overwhelming. High taxes were unavoidable, and so was waste. Add to it corruption, also inevitable when inspectors are afoot, and it should have been no surprise to the contemporaries that the program fell short of its aim. There was still poverty, derelicts on the street, unattended illness, and complaints of &amp;lsquo;not enough&amp;rsquo; from every welfared group in turn - workers, farmers, businessmen, doctors, artists, scientists, teachers, prisoners, and the homeless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jacques Barzun &lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060928832?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=widawamin-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0060928832&#34;&gt;&lt;i&gt;From Dawn to Decadence: 500 Years of Western Cultural Life, 1500 to the Present&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img alt=&#39;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;1&#34; src=&#34;http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=widawamin-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=0060928832&#34; style=&#34;border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;&#34; width=&#34;1&#34; /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&amp;mdash;

      <title>The science of happiness</title>
      <link>http://ryanmccarl.com/post/the-science-of-happiness/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Excerpts from Richard Layard&amp;rsquo;s &lt;span style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;Happiness: Lessons from a New Science&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The extra happiness provided by extra income is greatest when you are poor, and declines steadily as you get richer.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ldquo;Required income&amp;rdquo; varies strongly with the actual income that an individual currently experiences.  A dollar rise in experienced income causes a rise of at least a forty cents in &amp;ldquo;required income.&amp;rdquo;  So when I earn an extra dollar this year, it makes me happier, but next year I shall measure my income from a benchmark that is forty cents higher.  In this sense at least 40% of this year&amp;rsquo;s gain is &amp;ldquo;wiped out&amp;rdquo; next year.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Differences in family situation cause a huge difference in happiness.  If someone is divorced, that person&amp;rsquo;s happiness falls by 5 (percentage) points.  This is more than double the effect of losing a third of one&amp;rsquo;s income.  &amp;hellip;The year of divorce is the worst.  After that year men return on average to their baseline level of happiness, but women continue to suffer.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;If our goals are too low, we get bored.  But if they are too high, we get frustrated.  The secret is to have goals that are stretching enough, but not too stretching.  Unattainable goals are a well-known cause of depression.  But so too is boredom.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;The typical Briton watches television for three and a half hours a day - roughly twenty-five hours a week.  Over a lifetime a typical Briton spends more time watching television than doing paid work.  The figures are much the same in the United States.  &amp;hellip; This viewing time has to come from somewhere, and it mainly comes from social life.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;So how does the content of television affect our feelings about life, and our behavior?  If television simply mirrored life as it is, it would be unlikely to have much effect.  However, it does not simply mirror life - that would be boring.  Television focuses far more on the extremes.  It contains far more violence, sex, and chaotic relationships than ordinary life does, and it contains far more wealth and beauty.  &amp;hellip;Chaos on the screen tends to desensitize - to make people more willing to engage in violence themselves and in illicit sex.  At the same time wealth and beauty create discontent with what people have - an itch to earn or steal more wealth, or to find a more beautiful partner.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;On one estimate an extra hour a week watching television causes you to spend an extra $4 a week - on &amp;ldquo;keeping up with the Joneses.&amp;rdquo;  &amp;hellip;It reduces our happiness with our possessions.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Viewing may also reduce our happiness with our bodies, and with our spouses.  The psychologist Douglas Kenrick showed women a series of female models.  He evaluated their mood before and after they looked at the pictures.  After seeing the models, the women&amp;rsquo;s mood fell.  So how must women&amp;rsquo;s moods be affected by television?  In three hours of viewing television each day you cannot fail to see a parade of beautiful women.  What about the effect on men?  As part of the same series of experiments, pictures of models were shown to a sample of men.  Kenrick evaluated their feelings about their wives before and after each presentation.  After seeing the models, most men felt less good about their wives.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Trustworthiness is crucial in any venture, and no long-term contract can flourish except on the basis of commitment to the common goal.  This applies in business, in friendship or in marriage.  Unfortunately, the growth of individualism has encouraged a short-term version of &lt;span style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;contractarian&lt;/span&gt; thinking, where more and more decisions are conducted on the basis of a short-term quid pro quo. &amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this environment of continuous reoptimization, it is not surprising that, as we have seen, people are less satisfied with their marriages.  There is also clear evidence that when spouses arrange their lives on the basis of quid pro quo, they are less satisfied with the marriage than when it is based on the concept of giving.  &amp;hellip;The evidence also shows that when one spouse does something and the other spouse reciprocates, the first gets less satisfaction than when no direct reciprocation occurs.  This is because giving confers satisfaction, and can confer more satisfaction than taking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Above all, we need to know that our partner has sufficient emotional commitment to the enterprise.  If so, we know the partner will stick to the relationship, even when short-term advantage would say &amp;ldquo;Out.&amp;rdquo;  &amp;hellip;If both parties know that the other is really committed, each will invest more and the probability of success will rise.  In all walks of life, good behavior by one person elicits good behavior by others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Richard Layard&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;Happiness: Lessons from a New Science&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&amp;mdash;

      <title>Quotes from Steinbeck&#39;s &#39;East of Eden&#39;</title>
      <link>http://ryanmccarl.com/post/quotes-from-steinbecks-east-of-eden/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 02 Jun 2007 21:38:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://ryanmccarl.com/post/quotes-from-steinbecks-east-of-eden/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m 180 pages into &lt;em&gt;East of Eden; &lt;/em&gt;here are a few of the passages that have caught my attention thus far:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it never failed that during the dry years the people forgot about the rich years, and during the wet years they lost all memory of the dry years. It was always that way.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;To Adam who was an instrument, who saw not the future farms but only the torn bellies of fine humans, it was revolting and useless. When he fired his carbine to miss he was committing treason against his unit, and he didn&amp;rsquo;t care. The emotion of nonviolence was building in him until it became a prejudice like any other thought-stultifying prejudice. To inflict any hurt on anything for any purpose became inimical to him.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;A thing so triumphantly illogical, so beautifully senseless as an army can&amp;rsquo;t allow a question to weaken it.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;It is possible that his virtue lived on a lack of energy.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;He lived in a world shining and fresh and as uninspected as Eden on the sixth day. His mind plunged like a colt in a happy pasture, and when later the world put up fences he plunged against the wire, and when the final stockade surrounded him, he plunged right through it and out. And as he was capable of great joy, so did he harbor huge sorrow, so that when his dog died the world ended.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Charles developed a restlessness that got him out at dawn. He worked the farm mightily because he was lonely.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Adam felt that he was sleepwalking. It is a hard thing to leave any deeply routined life, even if you hate it. In the morning he awakened on a split second and lay waiting for reveille. His calves missed the hug of leggings and his throat felt naked without its tight collar.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Adam walked through the dark town, increasing his speed as though his loneliness sniffed along behind him.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Adam said, &amp;lsquo;Let me tell you. The proofs that God does not exist are very strong, but in lots of people they are not as strong as the feeling that He does.&amp;rsquo;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;If the Germans had known Olive and had been sensible they would have gone out of their way not to anger her.  But they didn&amp;rsquo;t know or they were stupid.  When they killed Martin Hopps they lost the war because that made my mother mad and she took out after them.  She had liked Martin Hopps.  He had never hurt anyone.  When they killed him Olive declared war on the German empire.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;The Catholic church, first on the scene and deeply dug in, sat in comfortable tradition while the missions were gradually abandoned and their roofs fell in and pigeons roosted on the stripped altars.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Louis said half derisively and half with admiration, &amp;lsquo;He&amp;rsquo;s always thinking about how to change things.  He&amp;rsquo;s never satisfied with the way they are.&amp;rsquo;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lsquo;My dear,&amp;rsquo; he said, &amp;lsquo;can&amp;rsquo;t you see?  You must not destroy life.  That&amp;rsquo;s the one thing that gets me crazy.  God knows I lose patients because I don&amp;rsquo;t know enough.  But I try - I always try.  And then I see a deliberate killing.&amp;rsquo;  He talked rapidly on.  He dreaded the sick silence between his sentences.  &amp;hellip; &amp;lsquo;Have you met Mrs. Laurel?  She&amp;rsquo;s wasting and crying for a baby.  Everything she has or can get she would give to have a baby, and you - you try to stab yours with a knitting needle.&amp;rsquo;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps Adam did not see Cathy at all, so lighted was she by his eyes.  Burned in his mind was an image of beauty and tenderness, a sweet and holy girl, precious beyond thinking, clean and loving, and that image was Cathy to her husband, and nothing Cathy did or said could warp Adam&amp;rsquo;s Cathy.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;A man&amp;rsquo;s mind vagued up a little, for how can you remember the feel of pleasure or pain or choking emotion?  You can remember only that you had them.  &amp;hellip; Oh, strawberries don&amp;rsquo;t taste as they used to and the thighs of women have lost their clutch!&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Our species is the only creative species, and it has only one creative instrument, the individual mind and spirit of a man.  Nothing good was ever created by two men.  There are no good collaborations, whether in music, in art, in poetry, in mathematics, in philosophy.  Once the miracle of creation has taken place, the group can build and extend it, but the group never invents anything.  The preciousness lies in the lonely mind of a man.  &amp;hellip; And this I believe: that the free, exploring mind of the individual is the most valuable thing in the world.  And this I would fight for: the freedom of the mind to take any direction it wishes, undirected.  And this I must fight against: any idea, religion, or government which limits or destroys the individual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Amazing stuff.  More to come.]&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&amp;mdash;
