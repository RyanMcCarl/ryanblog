      <description>&lt;p&gt;In an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/jul/24/edge-closing-the-book-on-a-bad-read/?page=2&#34;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; published in Friday&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Washington Times&lt;/em&gt;, economist &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.marginalrevolution.com/&#34;&gt;Tyler Cowen&lt;/a&gt; makes several interesting and provocative arguments about reading and books.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  &amp;ldquo;What should you do when, 20, 50 or 100 pages in, you realize you just don&amp;rsquo;t like a book?&amp;rdquo;  Cowen says: &amp;ldquo;Give up.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  &amp;ldquo;We should treat books a little more like we treat TV channels,&amp;rdquo; (Cowen) argues. No one has trouble flipping away from a boring series.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  &amp;ldquo;(Cowen) notes that many up-and-coming writers complain they can&amp;rsquo;t break through in a best-seller-driven marketplace. &amp;lsquo;We&amp;rsquo;re also making markets more efficient,&amp;rdquo; Mr. Cowen says. &amp;ldquo;If you can sample more books, you&amp;rsquo;re giving more people a chance.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The article goes on to discuss several other readers who advocate quitting &amp;ldquo;boring&amp;rdquo; books: &amp;ldquo;One of her online friends reminded her there&amp;rsquo;s even an abandonment rule: The &amp;lsquo;Deduct Your Age From 100 and Read That Many Pages Before Giving Up on a Book&amp;rsquo; rule&amp;rdquo;; and &amp;ldquo;Having an e-book reader has made Ms. Wendell more ruthless. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m holding 100+ books on one device. If one isn&amp;rsquo;t floating my boat, I can move on to something else by pressing one button,&amp;rdquo; she points out.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So should we finish the books we begin?  The short answer: it depends.  On what?  That&amp;rsquo;s more difficult, but it depends on something more than how much we are &lt;em&gt;enjoying&lt;/em&gt; the book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why did you pick up the book in the first place?  If you are reading for pure entertainment, it makes sense to put the book down if you aren&amp;rsquo;t feeling entertained after giving the book a fair shot.  But surely most readers read for more than pure entertainment; if &amp;ldquo;entertainment&amp;rdquo; were the ultimate goal, there would be no reason to prefer an entertaining book over an equally or more entertaining movie, television show, or video game.  In fact, I suspect that the widespread idea that books are primarily sources of entertainment is partially responsible for the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nea.gov/news/news04/ReadingAtRisk.Html&#34;&gt;decline of book-reading&lt;/a&gt;, especially among young people, in recent decades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I choose and read books that are rewarding and that will enrich my understanding of the world, of myself, and of the human condition.  If they are entertaining or exciting at the same time, so much the better, but that isn&amp;rsquo;t the primary goal.  In fact, my idea of what is &amp;ldquo;entertaining&amp;rdquo; has shifted.  I have conditioned myself to prefer forms of leisure - i.e., reading good books, practicing banjo and listening to music, engaging in good conversation, watching good movies - that are rewarding and educative.  So even if I am reading a book that I must struggle to get through, that to me is often more entertaining than reading, say, &lt;em&gt;Angels and Demons&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are, in short, problems with considering a book&amp;rsquo;s excitement and ease the most important factors in deciding whether to read it or finish it.  We build our literacy and expand our understanding by reading material that challenges us, just as a musician continually improves his or her proficiency in an instrument not by playing the same basic tunes over and over, but by constantly pushing his or her limits by tackling new, more frustrating and difficult works and techniques.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have as much trouble as anyone with finishing books, but some books are worth finishing regardless of whether I feel like finishing them.  The other week, I completed &lt;em&gt;Moby-Dick&lt;/em&gt; after a slow, gradual, four-month effort.  &lt;em&gt;Moby-Dick&lt;/em&gt; would certainly fail the &amp;ldquo;entertainment&amp;rdquo; test for the vast majority of readers, including me.  And yet it is now one of my favorite books, because Melville&amp;rsquo;s incredible use of language and his insights into religion, human nature, and life itself made &lt;em&gt;Moby-Dick&lt;/em&gt; matter to me: I read it in the hope that it might change the way I write, think, and see the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steinbeck writes in &lt;em&gt;East of Eden&lt;/em&gt;: &amp;ldquo;You can start reading if you want and it will raise up your lid a little.&amp;rdquo;  That&amp;rsquo;s as good a statement as any of what good books are for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Hat tip for the link to the Washington Times article: &lt;a href=&#34;http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/&#34;&gt;Andrew Sullivan&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&amp;mdash;

      <title>Quotes from Harrison&#39;s &#39;Returning to Earth&#39;</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was good to finally know that the spirit was everywhere rather than a separate thing.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;Clare fed our leftover sandwiches to a stray mutt, who didn&amp;rsquo;t chew the proper thirty-two times.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;All of my jobs had kept me grounded in actual life whereas simply sitting in my room with my studies tended to make me unstable.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;In New York City the endless blocks of huge buildings say to us, I&amp;rsquo;m serious and within me serious people are doing serious things even though five thousand people in a building might only be playing with the market edge.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a local euphemism in the U.P. that you&amp;rsquo;re not lost, you just can&amp;rsquo;t find your vehicle.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;A local politician rejecting foreign languages in a school budget had said, &amp;lsquo;If English was good enough for Jesus Christ it&amp;rsquo;s good enough for our kids.&amp;rsquo;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;I agreed with K on the addition of what is called a &amp;lsquo;space blanket&amp;rsquo; to the survival kits I put together and distribute for Mexicans intending to migrate north.  Space blankets are sheets of material used by campers to protect them from cold and dampness but I thought they could also defend against the summer heat of the ground, which reaches over one hundred and fifty degrees.  ..The packet was in a Velcro latched bag and could be attached to a waiste belt and weighed a little less than five pounds.  I distributed these free of charge to workers&amp;rsquo; groups and through left-leaning Catholic priests.  I was opposed by many on both sides of the border for political reasons, which didn&amp;rsquo;t bother me except for the legal expenses I incurred avoiding prosecution by the United States.  My raison d&amp;rsquo;etre was simple on the surface.  Estimates of crossing deaths along the entire nineteen-hundred-mile border with Mexico went as high as two thousand a year.  I had learned to be goofy rather than logically argumentative with my opponents.  I&amp;rsquo;d ask, If you could prevent twenty major airline disasters each year, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you?&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;By common consent we didn&amp;rsquo;t talk about anything more serious than the food and music, which in themselves have become more serious as I get older.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;He needed Montana but he also needed Chicago for her museums, libraries, theaters, bookstores, and most of all classical music, which he preferred to hear live.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;After a passing glance I averted my eyes from a photo of Carla and me at the cabin and then I fixed on it.  Was I ever that young?&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;There are no damaged goods when everyone is damaged goods.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about travel, though, is that it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to be consumed by the past against the backdrop of a fresh landscape.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lsquo;I was sorry to hear about Donald.  There was a man who could put in a day&amp;rsquo;s work.&amp;rsquo; I shook his hand as he offered this ultimate compliment of the north.  His hand felt like a semipetrified baseball mitt.  &amp;lsquo;You might not remember me.  Donny and me played football way back when, then worked together.  The name&amp;rsquo;s Teddy.&amp;rsquo;  He bowed, his face reddening, and walked away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lsquo;You were the left tackle,&amp;rsquo; I called out and he turned and grinned.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;On all levels the main reason to live is because you&amp;rsquo;re already alive.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;While we were out on the park bench a small bank of clouds came across the sun turning our mood somber.  He said, &amp;lsquo;After all, the fact of death is the most brutal thing we humans are forced to accept,&amp;rsquo; but then the sun came out again and I told him that the day after the burial Herald had said, &amp;lsquo;Mother, it can&amp;rsquo;t be awful if it happens to every living thing.&amp;rsquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jim Harrison&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;ndash;&lt;em&gt;Returning to Earth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy Jim Harrison&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;True North&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Returning-to-Earth/Jim-Harrison/e/9780802143310/?itm=3&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Returning to Earth&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://search.barnesandnoble.com/True-North/Jim-Harrison/e/9780802142061/?itm=1&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&amp;mdash;
