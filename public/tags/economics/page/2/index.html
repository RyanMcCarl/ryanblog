      It was good to finally know that the spirit was everywhere rather than a separate thing.
&hellip;
Clare fed our leftover sandwiches to a stray mutt, who didn&rsquo;t chew the proper thirty-two times.
&hellip;
All of my jobs had kept me grounded in actual life whereas simply sitting in my room with my studies tended to make me unstable.
&hellip;
In New York City the endless blocks of huge buildings say to us, I&rsquo;m serious and within me serious people are doing serious things even though five thousand people in a building might only be playing with the market edge.

      Excerpts from Richard Layard&rsquo;s Happiness: Lessons from a New Science:
The extra happiness provided by extra income is greatest when you are poor, and declines steadily as you get richer.
&hellip;
&ldquo;Required income&rdquo; varies strongly with the actual income that an individual currently experiences. A dollar rise in experienced income causes a rise of at least a forty cents in &ldquo;required income.&rdquo; So when I earn an extra dollar this year, it makes me happier, but next year I shall measure my income from a benchmark that is forty cents higher.

      Among the many definitions of Communism, perhaps one would be the most apt: enemy of orchards. For the disappearance of villages and the remodeling of the terrain necessitated cutting down the orchards once surrounding every house and hut. The idea of collective farming - grain factories instead of little peasant lots - was rational, but with a vengeance, and a similar vengeance lurking in practically every project of the planned economy brought about the downfall of the Soviet system.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      I&rsquo;ve recently started exploring the ideas of liberal economists - those economists who advise and formulate policy for Democratic candidates. I&rsquo;ve downloaded a few fantastic lectures by Robert Reich, Secretary of Labor under President Clinton. And I recently read a book on inequality by Robert Frank, professor of economics at Cornell. The book - Falling Behind: How Rising Inequality Harms the Middle Class - is one of the most interesting policy essays I&rsquo;ve read in a long time.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      As we would expect, during most wars consumer spending is deliberately held back by heavy taxes to make room for swelling military expenditure. During World War II, for example, consumption was squeezed back by heavy taxes to barely more than half of GDP. …During the Vietnam War military expenses for that conflict were not compensated by taxes to roll back consumption and the excess demand for goods and services ignited a subsequent inflation.

      <p>From How It Should Be in Heaven</p>

<p>How it should be in Heaven I know, for I was there.
By its river. Listening to its birds.
In its season: in summer, shortly after sunrise.
…
Peace eternal
Could have no mornings and no evenings,
Such a deficiency speaks against it.
And that’s too hard a nut for a theologian to crack.

A business that makes nothing but money is a poor kind of business.</p>

    <h2><a href="http://ryanmccarl.com/post/robert-gilpin-on-the-case-for-free-trade/">Robert Gilpin on the case for free trade</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      Economists of every persuasion are convinced that free trade is superior to trade protection. In fact, they consider free trade to be the best policy for a country even if all other countries should practice trade protection, arguing that if other countries resort to trade protection, the economy that remained open would still gain more from cheaper imports than it would lose in denied export markets.
&hellip;
Underlying this liberal commitment to free trade is the belief that the purpose of economic activity is to benefit the consumer and maximize global wealth.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      The (National Assessment of Educational Progress economics exam), taken by a representative sample of twelfth graders at public and private high schools, tested students on micro- and macroeconomic principles and international trade. What, for example, is the effect of breaking down trade barriers between countries? A majority correctly said that goods would become less expensive. They chose this over &ldquo;the quality of goods available would decrease.&rdquo; Maybe John Edwards should hire more teenagers for his Presidential campaign.

      An hour later, my thoughts are full of joy. Even little things affect me: a veil flutters on a hat, a lock of hair comes undone, two eyes close with laughter - and I am moved. Oh, this day, this day!
&hellip;
When you came, there was sympathy in your face and your eyes shone, you gave me your hand. Now your eyes are indifferent again. Am I mistaken?

      A Short History
Corn planted us; tamed cattle made us tame.
Thence hut and citadel and kingdom came.
&ndash;Richard Wilbur
Let us not fool ourselves. What we knew is dead, and maybe the greatest part of what we were is dead. What&rsquo;s out there is perhaps good, but it&rsquo;s nothing we know.
&ndash;John Steinbeck, Travels with Charley
The place of my origin had changed, and having gone away I had not changed with it.
